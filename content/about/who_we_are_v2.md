We describe ourselves as _**Your Independent Generalist Advisory Service**_ and in the following sections, we will elaborate on each aspect of this description.

#### Your
Our clients are the focal point of our [mission](/about/ourmission.html), the vision we strive for in the future, and the core [values](/about/ourvalues.html) that guide us. It's your ambitions, challenges, problems, or aspirations that we aim to address. Our goal is to provide tailored solutions that best suit your specific context, situation, and needs.

> _“Do what you do so well that they will want to see it again and bring their friends.”_
> - **Walt Disney**

#### Independent
Independence is a cornerstone of our approach, ensuring that you always receive the best advice we can provide. Being independent allows us to apply [critical thinking](https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766) to our work, the advice we offer, and the recommendations we provide. Our independence empowers us to consider different perspectives and question established truths, practices, and worldviews without being constrained by organizational norms and culture.

This spirit of independence is reflected in our values of "Taking **Ownership**" and "Always Acting with **Integrity**."

> *“One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we have large groups of people who will accept whatever they hear on the grapevine, just because it suits their worldview—not because it is actually true or because they have evidence to support it. The really striking thing is that it would not take much effort to establish validity in most of these cases… but people prefer reassurance to research.”*
> - **Neil deGrasse Tyson**

#### Generalist
Our specialization is our versatility. While you may have deep knowledge of your specific domain, we bring a broad range of knowledge to the table. As generalists, we strive to possess knowledge on a wide array of topics. This breadth enables us to recognize interconnections between different domains and propose solutions that specialists may overlook. Although specialists excel in their areas, a generalist can offer a holistic perspective, generating ideas and solutions that benefit the entire business.

"In a rapidly changing workplace, transferable skills are becoming increasingly important. Generalists tend to possess more transferable skills."

Our generalist approach aligns with our values of "Being **Curious** about all things" and "Diving **Deep** into matters."

> *"I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself."*
> - **Elon Musk**

#### Advisory Service
Collaboration is at the core of how we secure your interests. Formally, Advisory Services encompass the development and presentation of findings, conclusions, and recommendations to guide client decision-making. Informally, we provide guidance and recommendations to shape prudent future actions. We assist our clients in navigating their challenges and transforming them into new business-as-usual practices, ensuring that the destiny of their business remains in their hands.

The advisory perspective is reflected in our company's values of "Being kind to **People**" and "Inspiring **Greatness** in others."

> *"If you are going to do something, you have to do it for yourself, and that's what I try to do. I try to be authentic and try to be original, so that's what I try to be. A lot of people try to build big brands but have received bad advice, and they don't try to be authentic and real with themselves."*
> - **Giannis Antetokounmpo**
