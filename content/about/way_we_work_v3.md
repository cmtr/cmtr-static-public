We define our selves as a **_Your Independent Generalist Advisory Service_** which is closely tied to our values as followes: 

* The _independence_ is reflected in our company valeus as *Take **Ownership** and Always act with **Integrity***. This is how we act. 
* The _generalist_ approach is reflected in our company's values as *Be **Curious** to all things and **Dive Deep** in to the matter*. This how we learn and improve.
* The _advisory_ perspective is reflected in our company's values as *Be nice to **People** and **Inspire** greatness in others*. This is how we work together.

To implement this in the day to day way we work, we use _Our Guiding Model that Drives All Our Efforts_. The model guides us in the areas of which we work - the instersection between *business, technology, organization* and *people* - and guides us by allways considering all things from the following it's four perspectives.

### The Types of Endevours, Problems & Challanges

The military and businesses classify threats and challenges in different ways based on their knowledge of the threat's characteristics and existence. Known-known threats are those that they are aware of and know the characteristics of. Unknown-known threats are those that they don't have knowledge of but are generally aware of their characteristics. Know-unknown threats are those that they know of but don't know their exact characteristics, like a "Lone Wolf." Lastly, unknown-unknown threats are those that they have no knowledge of both their existence and characteristics, like a "Black Swan."

For businesses, the unknown-unknown represents the biggest challenge, as it requires going from zero to one. However, this is not the most common type of problem faced by businesses, as most business models involve going from one to many or many to many. Moreover, organizing a business poses common challenges and problems that are faced by all businesses, including known-knowns, unknown-knowns, and known-unknowns. Therefore, the challenge is not insufficient information but rather the correct utilization of the available information.

Given the assumption that most business challenges stem from the correct utilization of information, we have established our guiding model to approach and evaluate them.

### Our Guiding Model
The basis for _our guiding model_ is to allways evaluate the endevour, challange or problem from the following perspectives:
* **Business** - Why
* **Organization** - How
* **Technology** - What
* **People** - Who

**Image:** Our Guiding Model that Drives All Our Efforts



> At our company, we believe that a holistic approach is necessary to provide effective solutions and advice to our clients. That's why we always evaluate every endeavor, challenge, or problem from four different perspectives: Business, Organization, Technology, and People.



### The Business Perspective
The Business perspective addresses the "why" of the endeavor. We examine the business goals and objectives, the desired outcomes, and the potential risks and opportunities involved. This allows us to align our recommendations with our clients' strategic direction and help them achieve their business objectives.

> The business perspective represents the why of the endevour, challange or problem. E.g. why a product is being created, why a project is being performed, or why is it it a problem. For us this encompases the need, reason for effort and desired value to be obtained.  

> *“A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all: solve the correct problem.”*
> - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things

### The Organization Perspective
The Organization perspective focuses on the "how" of the endeavor. We look at the organizational structure, culture, and processes to understand how the work will be done and who will be responsible for it. By analyzing these factors, we can identify potential roadblocks, optimize workflows, and ensure that our recommendations are realistic and actionable.


> The organizational perspective represents the how of the endovour, challange or problem. How are the resources, both people, capital and technology, organized to address to problem to day? How can they be organized to achieve the desired outcome? 

> _“Norman’s Law: The day the product team is announced, it is behind schedule and over its budget.”_
> - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things

### The Technology Perspective
The Technology perspective deals with the "what" of the endeavor. We consider the technical requirements, constraints, and opportunities to determine what technology solutions would be best suited to meet the business objectives. We also take into account the current technology landscape, potential risks, and the feasibility of implementation to provide informed recommendations.

> The technology perspective representents the what - or the outcome - of the endevour, challange or problem. The definition of technology is _the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes"_. In our view, technology limited to machinery, equipment and code, but also includes the governenace, processes, standardization, best practice, etc. that achieves the practical purpose.

> _“It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.”__
> - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things

### The People Perspective
Finally, the People perspective addresses the "who" of the endeavor. We recognize that people are the driving force behind any successful endeavor, and we strive to understand the needs and motivations of all stakeholders involved. By identifying potential resistance or barriers to adoption, we can help our clients implement solutions that are both effective and well-received by their teams.

> The people perspective represent the whom of the endevour, challange or problem. It is the people it's created by; it is the people it's created for; and it is directly related to all the three other categories. We have placed it in the center of our model because it should always be considered. A process that goes against human nature is doomed to fail, a software that causes alot of cognitive strain will not be used, organization around a single person is susptible for collapse and a business need that does address a persons need will have no champion. 

> _“The vicious cycle starts: if you fail at something, you think it is your fault. Therefore you think you can’t do that task. As a result, next time you have to do the task, you believe you can’t, so you don’t even try. The result is that you can’t, just as you thought.”__
> - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things

### The Intersection
By approaching every endeavor from these four perspectives, we can ensure that our recommendations are comprehensive, relevant, and actionable. We believe that this holistic approach sets us apart from other advisory services and allows us to provide our clients with truly valuable insights and recommendations.


> The intersection perspective is the synthezis of the business, organization, technology and people perspective. With a good understanding of the endevour, challange or problem from each of these perspectives, the solution usually become obvious. It is also when all these perspectives is understood that a solutions, which may be minor in scope, can result in efficiencies measured in the orders of magnitude.

> _"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"_
> - **Aristotle**

### Credits
We do not take credit for this model. It's a generic model that exists in many forms and variations. One example is the [PMI Talent Triangle](https://www.pmi.org/learning/training-development/talent-triangle) where the application is the human capital and talent management. We also want to give credits to Donald A. Norman for the influence his work has guided the work way we work and would encourge all our clients to read his book [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things).

# Feedback 
The provided text effectively communicates your consultancy's identity, values, and guiding principles. It uses clear language and distinct sections to convey its message. However, there are a few areas where you can make improvements:

1. **Formatting and Consistency**: While the text is generally well-structured, ensure consistent formatting throughout. For instance, make sure that the titles, such as "The Business Perspective" and "The Organization Perspective," are consistently formatted in terms of font style, size, and color.

2. **Simplification**: Some sentences could be simplified for clarity. For example, in the "The Organization Perspective" section, you might consider rephrasing the sentence: "We also take into account the current technology landscape, potential risks, and the feasibility of implementation to provide informed recommendations" to enhance readability.

3. **Visual Elements**: Since you have a model with four perspectives, consider incorporating visual elements, such as icons or diagrams, to represent these perspectives. Visual aids can make complex concepts more accessible to your audience.

4. **Links and Citations**: Ensure that all links to internal and external sources are functional. Also, consider including a brief citation for your quotes and references, such as Donald A. Norman's book.
