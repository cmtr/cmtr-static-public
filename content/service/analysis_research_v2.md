Business Analysis & Research is a critical discipline that enables organizations to identify and articulate the need for change and to facilitate that change in a strategic and effective way. Business Analysis & Research practitioners come in many different job titles, including Business Analysts, Business Systems Analysts, Systems Analysts, Requirements Engineers, Process Analysts, Product Managers, Product Owners, Enterprise Analysts, Business Architects, Management Consultants, Business Intelligence Analysts, and Data Scientists. The same can also be said for UX Designers and Market Analysts. All these professions, including management, project management, product management, software development, quality assurance, and interaction design, rely heavily on the same analysis and research tools, techniques, methodologies, and skills for success.

At its core, Business Analysis & Research is a disciplined approach for introducing and managing change to organizations. It is used to identify and articulate the need for change in how organizations work and to facilitate that change. The Business Analysts identify and define the solutions that will maximize the value delivered by an organization to its stakeholders. This requires work across all levels of an organization and may involve everything from defining strategy to creating the enterprise architecture to taking leadership roles by defining the goals and requirements for programs and projects or supporting continuous improvement in its technology and processes.

One of the most significant benefits of Business Analysis & Research is that it helps organizations deliver better results more efficiently and effectively than peer organizations with immature practices. According to PMI's Pulse of the Profession, 47% of unsuccessful projects fail to meet original goals due to poor requirements management. In another Pulse Report, 39% of failed projects identified inaccurate requirements gathering as a primary cause of failure. It further found that those organizations that demonstrate maturity in Business Analysis & Research practices are 55% more successful in implementing strategy and are much more likely to achieve the expected value from the investments made on programs and projects.

Organizations are often tempted to provide solutions before fully understanding a situation. Business Analysis & Research enables the organization to identify and fix the root causes of problems instead of repeatedly addressing symptoms as they occur. This helps organizations make informed decisions based on data and insights, which can ultimately lead to more successful outcomes.
