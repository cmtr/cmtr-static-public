# UX Reseach, Analysis & Design

User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

UX design covers a vast array of areas and has different meanings for differnet people, so before we start let's take a recap what UX Design is.

### What is UX anyways?

When asking what UX is? Many people answer me that UX is some form of what the UX Designers here do. Which, when diving deeper, is usually some subset of UX tasks or pure User Interface, Visual or Graphical Design. Inconsitencies in what UX Design Roles are further adds to the confusion.

A UX designer - to us - is concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function. It is a story that begins before the device is even in the user’s hands.


> *“No product is an island. A product is more than the product. It is a cohesive, integrated set of experiences. Think through all of the stages of a product or service – from initial intentions through final reflections, from first usage to help, service, and maintenance. Make them all work together seamlessly.”*
> - **Don Norman**, inventor of the term “User Experience”

Products that provide great user experience (e.g., the iPhone) are thus designed with not only the product’s consumption or use in mind but also the entire process of acquiring, owning and even troubleshooting it.

A UX designer should consider the Why, What and How of product use. The Why involves the users’ motivations for adopting a product, whether they relate to a task they wish to perform with it or to values and views which users associate with the ownership and use of the product. The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with.


UX design is a multidisciplinary field and process that encompasses the entire user journey.  Typical UX designer tasks vary, but often include user research, creating personas, designing wireframes and interactive prototypes as well as testing designs. These tasks vary from one team to the next, but they always demand designers to be the users’ advocate and keep the users’ needs at the center of all design and development efforts. 

That’s also why most UX designers work in some form of user-centered work process, and keep refining their best-informed efforts until they address all of the relevant issues and user needs optimally.
