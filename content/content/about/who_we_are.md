> *“One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we have large groups of people who will accept whatever they hear on the grapevine, just because it suits their worldview—not because it is actually true or because they have evidence to support it. The really striking thing is that it would not take much effort to establish validity in most of these cases… but people prefer reassurance to research.”*
> - **Neil deGrasse Tyson**


#### Generalist
This is what we bring to table. Our breadth of knowlege and your depth of knowledge is how we togheter move forward.

As generalists we stive to have knowledge on a broad range of issues. This so we can see the interconnectedness between domains and find solutions that a specialist might not be able to. Companies often have the specialist that know their busienss best, but all the different departments within a business do connect with each other. A generalist can help see this bigger picture and come up with ideas and solutions that benefit the business as a whole.

*In a fast-changing workplace, transferable skills are becoming increasingly important. Generalists tend to posses more transferable skills.*

The generalist approach is reflected in our companoury's values as _Be **Curious** to all things_ and _**Dive Deep** in to the matter_. 

> *"I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself."*
> - **Elon Musk**

#### Advisory Service
This is how we work together in order to secure your interests. Formally Advisory Services means the development and presentation of findings, conclusions, and recommendations for client consideration and decision making. Less formally, we provide guidance and recommendations with regard to prudent future action. We do this by help our clients by joining and guiding them through their journey of turning their challanges into their new business as usual. We believe the ownership for the business fate should lay within it's own hands.

The advisory perspective is reflected in our company's values as _Be nice to **People**_ and _**Inspire** greatness in others_. 

> *"If you are going to do something, you have to do it for yourself, and that's what I try to do. I try to be authentic and try to be original, so that's what I try to be. A lot of people try to build big brands but have received bad advice, and they don't try to be authentic and real with themselves."*
