### Act with **Integrity**

> *“As I have said, the first thing is to be honest with yourself. You can never have an impact on society if you have not changed yourself. Great peacemakers are all people of integrity, of honesty, but humility.”**
> - **Nelson Mandela**


### Take **Ownership**
> *"What you resist, persists. If you take ownership and deal with things that are bothering you, then, in the very process of dealing with them they very often will go away."**
> - **Anonymous**

### **Dive Deep** in to matter
> *“Although this was not a comforting point of view, he did not reject it, because it coincided with one of his basic beliefs: that a man must at all costs keep some part of himself outside and beyond life. If he should ever for an instant cease doubting, accept wholly the truth of what his senses conveyed to him, he would be dislodged from the solid ground to which he clung and swept along with the current, having lost all objective sense, totally involved with existence.”*
> - **Paul Bowles**, The Spider's House

### Be **Curious** to all things
> *“Why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what's on the other side?”*
> - **George R.R. Martin**, A Game of Thrones

### **Inspire** greathness in others
> *“Unleash the potential that is in another and you unleash the potential that is in you.”*
> - **Matshona Dhliwayo**

### Be nice to **People**
> *“Compassion and tolerance are not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength.”*
> - **Dalai Lama**
