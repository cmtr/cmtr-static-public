This is the third article in a series about how to perform Strategy Pyramid Analysis. The intended audience for this article series on _Strategic Pyramid Analysis_ are freelancers, teams, product managers & owners, business analyst, project & program managers, entrepreneurs or individuals looking to formalize the strategic work of their endeavor. The objective of this article series is to provide actionable recommendations for how to perform a such a analysis and establish whether such a analysis is suitable for you. 

The objective of this article is to provide a procedure for how to define your endeavors values.


### Values
The values are the ethics, beliefs, philosophies, and principles that drive your endeavor. It's quite simply what does the endeavor stand for?

Having clear values for your endeavor is the first step to ensure that all the endeavors members and stakeholders are working towards the same goals. This does not mean having a polished communication plan around nice values and principles. To truly benefit from defined values it is necessary to truly honor them in every part of the endeavor and for the leadership to set the right example for it's members and stakeholders. Every decision for the endeavors should strive to align with these values. It's the only then they can work as a way can building a strong culture.

### Defining the Endeavors Values

A clear set of values, agreed and understood by leadership and following is often attributed to being the secret behind most successful organizations. If your endeavor is yet to establish a set of values the below process can help you to identify and develop them. One of the ways to establish the your endeavors values is by using the Double Diamond Method.

> The double diamond is based on the frame innovation approach coined by Kees Dorst, Professor of Design Innovation at the University of Technology. In his approach, the design process can be divided into problem space and solution space. The **problem space** is when designers explore the problem, including its complex nature, and end with a clear definition of the problem. It is where the majority of the unique design characteristics and value lay, including creativity and uncertainty. The **second stage** is the solution space, where ideas are generated, visualized, and tested prototypes. At the end of this stage, the final product is created and delivered to the end-user.

### Preparations

Good preparations will increase the likelihood of a good outcome and reduce the collective time spent by the team. Time is money and committees can very time consuming. *Failing to plan, is planning to fail.*

In order for the analysis work to be effective, the analyst should do the following preparations:
* Participants
* Introduction
* Location

**Image** Planning

#### Participants
Most endeavors are team efforts and people have different values, beliefs, perceptions and ethics. Selecting the participants for the analysis so the resulting values reflect something all the endeavors members can identify with is imperative for their adaption. 

> **Affinity Bias**
>
> _Affinity bias, also known as similarity bias, is the tendency people have to connect with others who share similar interests, experiences and backgrounds. Affinity bias in the workplace: When companies hire for “culture fit,” they are likely falling prey to affinity bias._

Affinity bias is deeply ingrained in the human condition. When starting a analysis it is only natural that we would like to do it with the people we normally work with and trust. This may however result in outcomes that will not appeal to the endeavors members as a whole. The *analyst* should take care to include the people they normally do not work with or people that they do not like working with. If you can come to an agreement with them, the likelihood of getting something all can agree on is much higher. 

> **Confirmation Bias**
>
> _Confirmation bias is the inclination to draw conclusions about a situation or person based on your personal desires, beliefs and prejudices rather than on unbiased merit._

The importance of validating and testing your analysis method or output is even more important when you are without a team. Confirmation bias is a real and can result in outcomes that does not meet the endeavors benefactors needs. In such cases, using the lessons of [The Lean Startup Methodology](http://theleanstartup.com/) of always testing and validating is essential. You can use the people close to you, potential customers or strangers. Or else you may fall victim to confirmation bias and lose a lot of perspective.

#### Introduction

The purpose of the *workshop introduction* is to set the stage for the participants. When the participants understand the why, when, how and what of the workshop they are more likely to feel more secure in expressing their opinions and thoughts. To facilitate this, the *analyst* and *facilitator* should jointly prepare the following presentation material:

* The Workshop Objective - Why
* The Workshop Agenda - When
* The Methods - How
* The Outcome - What

The *analyst* should further prepare a selection of core values from offset endeavors. The participants familiarity with core values and how they are presented may differ. Having some examples can really help in their understanding of the task and also provide inspiration.

When looking for offsets, the *analyst* should follow good benchmarking practice and not just look at endeavors that do the same as them, but also endeavors that is generally recognized for their excellence in the field. 

>**Example Themes**
>* Business growth
>* Business associates
>* Work
>* Customer service
>* Decision making
>* Teamwork
>* Leadership
>* Business improvement
>* Staff
>* Market identity
>* Financial material
>* Social community
>* Environmental sustainability

The *analyst* should further prepare prepare a list themes - see examples about - and provide this to the *facilitator*. During the workshop introduction, the *facilitator* should ask the participants to reflect on each of the following questions for each of the selected themes. 

* What principles and values come to mind when you think of each theme?
* Why is each value you list important to you?
* What influence does it have on the way you approach or manage the endeavor?

The *analyst* should prepare for the workshop by providing a list of categories they think is most relevant for the endeavor.

In summary the _**Introduction Agenda**_ will be the following:
* The Workshop Objective - Why
* The Workshop Agenda - When
* The Methods - How
* The Outcome - What
* Offset Examples
* Reflective Themes & Questions


#### Location
The *analyst* and *facilitator* should find a location for the workshops. It should take be a comfortable place that have enough empty wall pace or a target whiteboard. This beneficial because of two main reasons: 
1. There will be many brainstorming drafts and sticky notes to visualize in front of the team through the process to keep in mind all the aspects of the design challenge at hand
2. Returning to the meeting room every morning and review the work done ensures the focus and continuity of the ideas as the team move from one step to another. 

The location should be prepared with:
* Post-it notes
* Markers
* Stickers
* Whiteboard

Distractions

### Workshop

The *discover* and *define* phase of the *problem space* in the *double diamond process* will be executed as part of a workshop.

#### Roles
The process will divide the effort and responsibility to the following roles:
* **Analyst** - The analyst is the person who analyses and documents the process.  
* **Facilitator** - The facilitator plans, guides and manages a group event to meet its goals.
* **Participants** - The persons who takes part in the analysis effort.
* **Decider** - The person with authority to make decisions.

The *analyst* and *facilitator* may often be the same person. It is also not uncommon for the analyst to be a *participant* or *decider*. It is generally recommended to have the roles separated in a workshop setting. This is primarily lessen the load on a single individual and allowing them to only perform their own role. Having one person perform several roles also reduces their ability to manage the bias associated with that role.


> **Anchor Bias**
>
> _Anchor bias or expectation anchor bias is when someone holds onto an initial, singular piece of information to make decisions._

The analyst can be strongly influenced based on the their preparatory efforts. The other roles may also be locked by their initial starting point. This can in particular be a challenge when that initial starting point was not based in reason. _"You cannot reason someone out of something he or she was not reasoned into."_

> **Authority Bias**
>
> _Authority bias refers to when an idea or opinion is given more attention or thought to be more accurate because it was provided by an authority figure._

The *facilitator* and *decider* both have an authority role in the workshop and may generate a authority bias within the group. When a workshop group consists of participants of different authority level - e.g. top leadership and on the floor workers - the opinions of the participants at the top may strongly influence those of the bottom.

> **Nonverbal Bias**
>
> _Nonverbal bias is analyzing nonverbal communication attributes such as body language and letting it affect a decision or opinion._

The *facilitator* can strongly influence the participants in how they structure the discussions and workshop. 

Both *analyst*, *decider* and *facilitator* should consider their body language towards the participants during a workshop. Even if they do not say anything, the body language may contribute to shifting the groups opinions in their desired direction.

#### Workshop Stages

The workshop agenda will be:

* Part 1 - Introduction
* Part 2 - Silent Brainstorm 
* Part 3 - Silent Review
* Part 5 - Silent Grouping
* Part 6 - Open Review
* Part 7 - Prioritization
* Part 8 - Reflection

##### Part 1 - Introduction

The facilitator is responsible for doing the introductory presentation.

**Introduction Agenda:**
* The Workshop Objective - Why
* The Workshop Agenda - When
* The Methods - How
* The Outcome - What
* Offset Examples
* Reflective Themes & Questions


It is customary to allow a short break of 10-15 minutes after the introduction before starting the next phase.

##### Part 2 - Silent Brainstorm
The first part in the *double diamond process*  is the *discovery* and *divergence* phase of the *problem space*.  

The objective of the silent brainstorm is to get as many relevant values as possible from the group. The silence of the brainstorm is a important step in creating divergence by emphasizing *individual* contributions. It also effectively prevents cooperation and group thinking and thus reduce **authority** and **nonverbal bias** among the participants as a group.

The first step in a silent brainstorm is for the *facilitator* to hand out a block sticky-note and a pen to each participant. All the participants should get the same color sticky notes and pens. Filt tip pens with a broad stroke is preferred for readability when place on a wall.

The *facilitator* should then instruct the participants to write down as many values or themes within the given time-box. The *facilitator* should further reassure the participants that it is no right or wrong way of defining the values. Some people think more in terms of actions, scenarios, situations or events that reflect a value. This is acceptable and is valid input for later refinement.

Once the instructions is provided and the tools handed out, the *facilitator* should start the time-box count down. A 2 to 5 minute time box is usually sufficient.

If the participants are inexperienced with the silent brainstorming technique, the participants may return only a few results. In this case, it may be helpful for the *facilitator* to use some of the offset values presented in the introduction as a supplement. These should be prepared before the session starts and be clearly marked that they wasn't part of the teams effort. The best way is to use a sticky-note of a different color.

![Offset Values Example](/assets/img/pub/values-offset-example.png "Example offset values - No duplicates")
**Image:** Example offset values

##### Part 3 - Silent Review
We continue the *discovery* and *divergence* phase by allowing each participant to become aware of the others perspective.

The *facilitator* will now ask the *participants* to take their sticky-notes and put them on the wall. Usually, people tend to put their own notes grouped together, but there is no rule as to where they are placed. 

When all the sticky-notes have been placed, the *facilitator* will ask the participants spend the next time-boxed amount to review each others values. A time-box of  3-5 minutes is usually sufficient, but there is not a hard time limit for this stage. The *participants* should be given sufficient time to take in the information.

If the *facilitator* see there is few suggestions, this is the time to add the supplement values from the introduction. It's best to let the participants first to review their own before placing the prepared ones.

The *facilitator* should document the placement of the notes. E.g. by taking a picture or if the exercise is performed online the *facilitator* should take a screenshot.

![Values Example - No duplicates](/assets/img/pub/values-silent-brainstorm-example1.jpg "Example Values - No duplicates")
**Image:** Example values for Silent Review

##### Part 4 - Silent Grouping
We now move out of the *discovery* and *divergence* phase, and start the *define* and *convergence* phase of the *problem space* in the *double diamond process*. We continue to take the of effect that authority and nonverbal bias can have on the participants thoughts, opinions and ideas into account and thus continue the workshop in silent mode. 

The *facilitator* should now introduce the *silent grouping method* to the *participants*. The silent grouping is simply letting the participants move the values together without being allowed to speak to each other. Everybody has the right to move a sticky-note and put it where they think it belongs. A sticky-note can be moved several times. The exercise does not have a time-box and is finished once the group stops moving the sticky-notes.

After the *participants* have grouped together the different items, the *facilitator* should review and think of a common theme for the different groups. The *facilitator* should however not share this view until after the open review.

The *facilitator* should take a picture of the whiteboard or wall at this stage to document the teams result.

As this concludes the silent part of the workshop it is a good time to the participants to have a break. This will give them time to reflect on what they have seen and done. It is also good opportunity for the participants to get to know each other better. Letting the workshop be a arena that foster psychological safety and trust in the group is important for capturing the diversity value of the group. A 15 minute break is good if the participants don't know each other well, but it can be shorter for teams that know each other well.  

![Silently Grouped Values](/assets//img/pub/values-silent-grouping-example1.jpg "Example Values after Silent Grouping - No duplicates")
**Image:** Silent Grouping with facilitator note

##### Part 5 - Open Review
In this stage we change the focus from individual contributions and will embrace techniques to emphasize group thinking. The desired result of these techniques is that each individual shall feel like they have contributed to the groups outcome and thus have a stake in it. This does not mean that they as an individuals total agree with the outcome, but they should think that the outcome is whats for the best of the group and endeavor. I.e. we are trying to take advantage of *conformity bias* in a controlled manner.

> **Conformity bias**
>
> *Conformity bias is the tendency people have to act similar to the people around them regardless of their own personal beliefs or idiosyncrasies — also known as peer pressure.*

The participants will now get the chance to explain or ask questions about what people meant about the stickies. The facilitator should also ask the group what their reasoning about the grouping was and if everybody agrees with the explanation provided. The facilitator should then present the teams they found among the values and listen to the teams assessment of the evaluation. The facilitator should then help the team define the themes of their groupings. 

* What is this value about?
* What do you really mean by it?
* Do think people outside this room will understand it the same way?
* Will your benefactors or stakeholders understand it?
* What assumptions are behind this value? 
* What other words, ideas or mental images do you associate with this value?

The sticky-notes is the property of the *analyst*. If there is a lot of duplicates, this could be a good opportunity to remove them from the wall. For sake of traceability use a different color sticky-note and mark it with how many stickies it replaced.

##### Part 6 - Prioritization
To prioritize and identify the values the team find most important, we'll start with the *dot voting technique*. Each participant will get a equal amount of small stickers each representing one vote. The participants are free to spend their votes as they please. This includes not spending them, as well as using multiple votes for the same item. 

The facilitator needs to evaluate how many stickers to give each participant based on  
* the amount of values proposed
* the desired amount of end values
* how many iterations or eliminations rounds will be performed to come to the end result.
If elimination is done over several rounds, then the facilitator can choose to let all sticky notes stay or remove the one not voted for.
If the workshop have selected to use a all powerful *Decision maker*, then it's important that the decision put their vote down after all the other participants.

##### Part 7 - Reflection
We have now narrowed down our values to workshop outcome. It's now time to reflect on both the outcome and the process so far. It is here important to give every participant the opportunity and safety to express themselves. The facilitator should let the participants speak freely about how they feel and think about the outcome first. To emphasize the psychological safety of the participants he should first let all the participants speak honestly, but stop the participants from criticizing each others reflection. 

Once everybody have given their personal reflection, the floor is open to critic or further reflection based on what others have said.  

This concludes this phase of the workshop, but it does not conclude the end of the reflection. The participants should now get some time to think about the outcome on their own. The time between the workshop and the follow-up session should at minimum be one week and include a period of leisure time (e.g. weekend). This is so the participants have time to reflect and let their subconscious can process the experience.  

To help the participants reflect, the facilitator/analyst should send a copy of the materials/artifacts and let them know there will ge a follow-up session within a given time.

>**Special Notes:**
>
>* Good dialog starters can be questions such as:
    * Do the participants agree with it? 
    * Was it what they imagined at the beginning?
>* This is also a great time for the facilitator to solicit feedback for how they thought the exercise went and what can be done better in the future.
>* If the workshop have selected to use a *decider*, the person should speak last.
>* The participants may use the time between the workshop and review to dicuss the process and the outcome among themselves. The individual participants should be able to reflect in the manner that suits them best, so the facilitator should neither encourage nor discourage such behaviour. 


### Refinement

The refinement phase reflects the *solution space* of the *double diamond process*.

##### Part 1 - Analysis
During the workshop, the analyst have collected the artifacts/materials generated during the workshop and taken notes about the participants. It is now time for to analyze, reflect and find common themes and messages that reflect values the participants have generated and prioritized.

The objective of the analysis is to apply a structured and unbiased look at the materials generated during the workshop. There is no one true way for how the analysis is performed as it's very dependent on the context, result and analyst preference. Some may prefer to do it as a solo effort and some as part of a group exercise. The main objective is to try and look at the material generated during the workshop to create a actionable outcome. This may be finding common themes or developing a example messages or stories that reflect the values of the group. 

Depending on the requirements, the outcome may be

* Just the single work values.
* Messages or stories to convey context of the values.
* Example behaviors in context of the company the shows them in effect.
* Presentation materials to communicate it to others not part of the group.


>**Special Notes:**
>
>* If someone have a combined role as analyst and participant, it may be may seem beneficial for the analyst that the session is recorded. This *observer effect* may however change how the participants behave during the workshop. Trusting a external analyst - i.e. outsider - with the recording may make the participants feel more secure with respect to the fear of group exclusion. The best outcome will however be when the analyst is an internal resource. 
>* It's highly recommended to validate the outcome with the participants or decision maker during the analysis work. 

##### Part 2 - Refinement
The refinement phase is a group activity with the objective of elaborating, validating and clarifying the outcome of the workshop and the analyst preparatory work.

Refinement can take many forms, but some factors are the same. The format should be session based with a clear agenda and time box. Having a relative short session duration makes the participants focus on the important issues. The participants should have access to the work material between sessions (e.g. for asynchronous work or reflection). 

Collaborative writing is one common method here. Done correctly, the work is documented as it is refined. Detailing the journey as it happens is a great way of displaying confidence to the end result as anyone can review the rationale behind the decisions made.

There is two ways of collaborative writing sessions. Everybody writes or a single person writes. Both have advantages and disadvantages. 

When everybody writes, people listen and talk less to each other. They may also focus on their individual little part and get excessive ownership to that part (i.e. source of conflict). The positive side is that everybody may feel they contribute and much more work is done at concurrently. 

When a single person writes, everybody focus on the same item at the same time. A problem with this approach is that some people may feel they are left out (i.e. the least vocal of the group). The person directing the meeting will also have much stronger influence over the outcome. 

Combining the two is also beneficial at times. The meetings will be a single person writes, but the participants have access to modify the content between meetings. 


##### Part 3 - Review
Its time to perform the review. As some time has past and the participants have had time to reflect on the workshop, it's good practice to start the session by soliciting their thoughts and feedback before the analyst presents his findings. 

The outcome of this meeting is one of three options:

* **Decide:** The participants or decision maker is happy with the results and ready to commit.
* **Iterate:** The participants or decision maker feel more confident with the process, but thinks it further investigation would be beneficial.
* **Terminate:** The participants or decision maker do not see value in proceeding any further with the work.

##### Part 3 - Iterate
Iteration would be to schedule a new workshop. As the participants are more familiar with the process and have already some thoughts about the outcome, the workshop can potentially be cut shorter. 

A different possibility is that group decision can be more challenging to achieve because some of the individual participants may be more committed to their own ideas. 

##### Part 4 - Decide
After the participants feel satisfied with the outcome, it is time to formally commit to them. 

### Conclusion

Defining your values seems like a easy task, but it can be a very time consuming - and this expensive - activity. The endeavors values are the foundational building blocks for it's strategy. If done honestly and lived by, it's a valuable excessive that can help cement the endeavors culture and be a real long term competitive advantage. If not, it will only be virtue posturing and risk a culture the promotes dishonesty and short term gains.
