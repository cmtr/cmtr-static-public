A common mission can help your endeavor increase participants engagement and work towards a common goal

### What you communicate outwards and inwards?

From ping-pong tables in the office to Google's bike meetings, it seems companies everywhere are trying to adopt incentives to build a successful business environment. These incentives, while they may seem great on the surface, have not been proven to retain and engage employees. A successful company culture starts with a defined, tangible mission.

> *It is fundamental to set the tone of the work environment, Employees these days are not as motivated by simply a paycheck. If you want employees who are going to go to battle with and for you, they need to feel connected to a deeper purpose or mission.*
> 
> **Jasmin Terrany**, a psychotherapist and life coach who supports professionals.

Creating a company mission also allows organizations to define what they stand for, which can lead to growth.

To develop the right kind of mission, business owners need to be honest with themselves and look to tangible values beyond profit. These values, or view of the world, can attract the right kind of employees and provide an organization with a framework for success.

### Part 1 - Define What You Do

The first thing to do is to outline what your endeavor does. This may be goods you produce or services you provide to your customers. From a product perspective it may be the pain that is alleviated or the need that is satisfied.

> It's important to not just state the obvious here and scratch the surface.
> **What did I think here?**

#### Workshop

There is many ways of holding a workshop and further more elicitation and decision techniques that can be used to define what you do. The below procedure just represent one way of doing it. It should be seen as a inspiration or guide and tailored to suit you endeavors situation.

##### Step  1 - Silent Brainstorm
The first step is to let each participant define what they think your endeavor do. The important thing here is to prevent co-operation and group thinking. Hence the participants should not be allowed to speak to each other or peek at each others sticky notes. A common way is to provide each participant with a block sticky-note, a pen and the instructions to write down as many of values they can think of within a given time, usually 2-4 minutes.

##### Step 2 - Open Review
Once everybody is ready, it is now time for the open review. Each participant should in turn go up to the whiteboard and present their sticky-notes. The participant should present all their ideas, even if they have been mentioned by somebody else before. Once everybody has presented, the group should discuss the ideas presented. This is also a good time to group related ideas together.

The group should in advance decide if they want everybody to present first and then comment, or if they want to comment as they go along. Different groups and cultures may have different preferences for such matters.

Hearing other peoples suggestions, may trigger new ideas. It should be the facilitators responsibility to capture and presented them as well.

##### Step 3 - Dive Deeper
The ideas may vary in the degree of specificity. This isn't in any way wrong, but often mean the underlay motivation doesn't come forth.

The Five Why's is a good exercise to dig a little deeper and get more ideas.

>**Five Whys Example - Robot Vacuum Cleaners**
>* **What do we do?** Make Robot Vacuum Cleaners
>    * **Why?** To help clean our customers houses
>        * **Why?** To help our customers health though a clean living space.
>    * **Why?** To automate household tasks
>        * **Why?** To free up our customers time 
>            * **Why?** To allow our customers to do the things they really enjoy
>        * **Why?** To stop cohabitants fighting about household tasks.
>            * **Why?** To let them have an enjoyable co-existence.
>
>Based on this, we could in addition to making robot vacuum cleaners say we are in the business of helping our customers live healthy and enjoyable lives.

**_The Five Why's_** can be used in many forms to drill down to the deeper issue. Many people have preferences for how to use the technique, but there is no objective right or wrong way to do it. Find the method that works best for your group. In the above example we made a tree-structure and didn't ask why five times in any of the branches. That is fine, because we found a satisfactory root cause root early. 

**Facilitator Note:** As we have not defined our customers yet, the notes with a specific customer type should be made generalized (i.e. call them the customer). The reason for this is to avoid unintentional constraints and influence on the participants thinking. If someone states who the customer is during this phase, it's important for the facilitator to emphasize that it is just one of the potential customers and such discussion should be taken in the next phase. Such a statement may influence the participants to try and identify other potential customer in their mind, hence mitigating the effects on the constraint. The facilitator should also note the customer type and acknowledge the contribution. 

##### Step 4 - Prioritization
We have now collected ideas and dived deeper into some of those ideas. It is now time for the group to prioritize the ideas they find most important. We'll use the *dot voting technique* to accomplish this. Each participant will get an equal amount of small stickers where each represent one vote. The participants are free to spend their votes as they please. This includes not spending them, as well as using multiple votes for the same item. 

It's important to note that this vote is not for elimination of ideas, but to give the group a shared picture of priorities. All the collected ideas should still be in play and the group should also welcome to add new ideas as they come.

**Facilitator Notes:** It can be beneficial to be restrictive with the amount of stickers give to the participants. Not all the participants may want to use all their stickers. This may result in a skewness towards the ones is less reserved with their votes. If you see that the group wants more stickers, you can always give them more. Additional insight may also be gained by giving them a different color sticker for the second round.

##### Step 5 - Reflection
Reflection comes in to forms: subconscious and conscious. Common for both of them, is that it requires some time. Dependent on the workshop plan, you may want to have a short break or a long break (i.e. multipart workshop).

### Part 2 - Define Who You Do It For

Next, describe the way in which your company does what it does. But instead of being technical — that's not the point here — think of what values go into the core of your business. Maybe you value quality or customer service, being sustainable, or you foster creativity and innovation in your business. These are key points to outline in your mission statement.

#### Workshop

The workshop for this phase is equal to the previous phase. If the participants is not familiar with the techniques and this way of working, expect significant improvements to this stage.  

* Step 1 - Silent Brainstorm
    - We repeat the *Silent Brainstorm* from the previous phase with the new focus.
* Step 2 - Open Review
    - We repeat the *Open Review* from the previous phase with the new focus.
* Step 3 - Dive Deeper
    - We repeat the *Dive Deeper* from the previous phase with the new focus.
* Step 4 - Prioritization
    - We repeat the *Prioritization* from the previous phase with the new focus.
* Step 5 - Reflection
    - It's again time for a short reflection

### Part 4 - Put it together

Finally, including why you do what you do in your mission statement is key. This helps you stand out as a business, highlighting what sets you apart from the others in your industry. Remember to keep the mission statement short and to the point.

### Part 5 - Review, Refine, Validate & Iterate

After you've drafted it, remember to look it over, edit it, and have someone else give it the once over. After you've approved it, you'll need to find a way to incorporate it wherever you can including on your website or as part of your ad campaigns—anywhere that it's visible to your stakeholders.

It's important to allow for enough time for reflection
