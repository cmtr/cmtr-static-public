          We define our selves as a **_Your Independent Generalist Advisory
          Service_** which is closely tied to our values as followes: 


          * The _independence_ is reflected in our company valeus as *Take
          **Ownership** and Always act with **Integrity***. This is how we act. 

          * The _generalist_ approach is reflected in our company's values as
          *Be **Curious** to all things and **Dive Deep** in to the matter*.
          This how we learn and improve.

          * The _advisory_ perspective is reflected in our company's values as
          *Be nice to **People** and **Inspire** greatness in others*. This is
          how we work together.


          To implement this in the day to day way we work, we use _Our Guiding
          Model that Drives All Our Efforts_. The model guides us in the areas
          of which we work - the instersection between *business, technology,
          organization* and *people* - and guides us by allways considering all
          things from the following it's four perspectives.


          ### The Types of Endevours, Problems & Challanges


          The military defines treaths by looking at them from two perspectives:
          1) the knowledgeability about the treath, and 2) the knowledge of the
          treath caracteristics. A _known-known_ treath is one where they have
          knowledge about both the existence and characteristics of. A
          _unknown-known_ treath is one where they donot have knowledge of, but
          the characteristics is generally known. A _know-unknown_ is risk they
          knowledge of, but not the exact characteristics of (e.g. a "Lone
          Wolf"). Lastly, a _unknown-unknown_ is one which there is no knowledge
          about both of its existence and characteristics (e.g. a "Black Swan").


          For both the military and business, the _unknown-unknown_ represents
          the biggest challange. In business, this is problem or opportunity
          that Peter Thiel would categorize as going from *[Zero to
          One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One)*. However, in business
          it is not the most frequent endevour, challange or problem faced. Most
          businesses models are of the type *One to Many* or *Many to Many*.
          Further more, most challenges and problems with organizing a business
          is also common amoung all businesses. They are accordingly faced with
          problems and challanges in the categories of _known-knowns_,
          _unknown-knowns_, and _known-unkowns_. Thus, the problems they face is
          not one of insufficent information, but rather one of correct
          utilization of the available information.


          This assumption that most endevours, challanges and problems faced
          with businesses today on one of correct utilization of information, we
          have established _our guiding model_ for how to approach and evaluate
          them. 


          ### Our Guiding Model

          The basis for _our guiding model_ is to allways evaluate the endevour,
          challange or problem from the following perspectives:

          * **Business** - Why

          * **Organization** - How

          * **Technology** - What

          * **People** - Who


          ![The Way We Work](/assets/img/about/way-we-work-002.png "The Way We
          Work")

          **Image:** Our Guiding Model that Drives All Our Efforts



          ### The Business Perspective

          The business perspective represents the why of the endevour, challange
          or problem. E.g. why a product is being created, why a project is
          being performed, or why is it it a problem. For us this encompases the
          need, reason for effort and desired value to be obtained.  


          > *“A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no
          solution at all: solve the correct problem.”*

          > - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things


          ### The Organization Perspective

          The organizational perspective represents the how of the endovour,
          challange or problem. How are the resources, both people, capital and
          technology, organized to address to problem to day? How can they be
          organized to achieve the desired outcome? 


          > _“Norman’s Law: The day the product team is announced, it is behind
          schedule and over its budget.”_

          > - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things


          ### The Technology Perspective

          The technology perspective representents the what - or the outcome -
          of the endevour, challange or problem. The definition of technology is
          _the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes"_. In
          our view, technology limited to machinery, equipment and code, but
          also includes the governenace, processes, standardization, best
          practice, etc. that achieves the practical purpose.


          > _“It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand
          people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless
          dictates of machines.”__

          > - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things


          ### The People Perspective

          The people perspective represent the whom of the endevour, challange
          or problem. It is the people it's created by; it is the people it's
          created for; and it is directly related to all the three other
          categories. We have placed it in the center of our model because it
          should always be considered. A process that goes against human nature
          is doomed to fail, a software that causes alot of cognitive strain
          will not be used, organization around a single person is susptible for
          collapse and a business need that does address a persons need will
          have no champion. 


          > _“The vicious cycle starts: if you fail at something, you think it
          is your fault. Therefore you think you can’t do that task. As a
          result, next time you have to do the task, you believe you can’t, so
          you don’t even try. The result is that you can’t, just as you
          thought.”__

          > - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things


          ### The Intersection

          The intersection perspective is the synthezis of the business,
          organization, technology and people perspective. With a good
          understanding of the endevour, challange or problem from each of these
          perspectives, the solution usually become obvious. It is also when all
          these perspectives is understood that a solutions, which may be minor
          in scope, can result in efficiencies measured in the orders of
          magnitude.


          > _"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"_

          > - **Aristotle**


          ### Credits

          We do not take credit for this model.It's a generic model that exists
          in many forms and variations. One example is the [PMI Talent
          Triangle](https://www.pmi.org/learning/training-development/talent-triangle)
          where the application is the human capital and talent management. We
          also want to give credits to Donald A. Norman for the influence his
          work has guided the work way we work and would encourge all our
          clients to read his book [The Design of Everyday
          Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things).

          # Your Independent Generalist Advisory Service


          We define ourself as a *Your Independent Generalist Advisory Service*
          but what do actually mean by this. We will here go into details on
          each point.


          #### Your

          Our clients is the object of our [mission](/about/ourmission) with the
          endevour, [vision](/about/ourvision) of the future, and core
          [values](/about/ourvalues). It's your ambitions, challanges, problems
          or aspirations we want to address. And to do so in the best possible
          way that suits your specific contect, situation and needs.


          > _“Do what you do so well that they will want to see it again and
          bring their friends.”_

          > - **Walt Disney**


          #### Independent

          This is how we act to ensure that you allways gets the best advise we
          can provide. By being independent we are free employ [critical
          thinking](https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766)
          in the work we do, advice we give and recommendation we provide. The
          independence enables us to take hold different perspectives and to
          question the establish truth, gospel, practices, ways of working and
          percived world views, by not being subject to the limitations by the
          norms and culture of an organization. 


          This independence is reflected in our valeus as _Take **Ownership**_
          and _always act with **Integrity**_.


          > *“One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we have
          large groups of people who will accept whatever they hear on the
          grapevine, just because it suits their worldview—not because it is
          actually true or because they have evidence to support it. The really
          striking thing is that it would not take much effort to establish
          validity in most of these cases… but people prefer reassurance to
          research.”*

          > - **Neil deGrasse Tyson**



          #### Generalist

          This is what we bring to table. Our breadth of knowlege and your depth
          of knowledge is how we togheter move forward.


          As generalists we stive to have knowledge on a broad range of issues.
          This so we can see the interconnectedness between domains and find
          solutions that a specialist might not be able to. Companies often have
          the specialist that know their busienss best, but all the different
          departments within a business do connect with each other. A generalist
          can help see this bigger picture and come up with ideas and solutions
          that benefit the business as a whole.


          *In a fast-changing workplace, transferable skills are becoming
          increasingly important. Generalists tend to posses more transferable
          skills.*


          The generalist approach is reflected in our companoury's values as _Be
          **Curious** to all things_ and _**Dive Deep** in to the matter_. 


          > *"I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're
          constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing
          it better. I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly
          think about how you could be doing things better and questioning
          yourself."*

          > - **Elon Musk**


          #### Advisory Service

          This is how we work together in order to secure your interests.
          Formally Advisory Services means the development and presentation of
          findings, conclusions, and recommendations for client consideration
          and decision making. Less formally, we provide guidance and
          recommendations with regard to prudent future action. We do this by
          help our clients by joining and guiding them through their journey of
          turning their challanges into their new business as usual. We believe
          the ownership for the business fate should lay within it's own hands.


          The advisory perspective is reflected in our company's values as _Be
          nice to **People**_ and _**Inspire** greatness in others_. 


          > *"If you are going to do something, you have to do it for yourself,
          and that's what I try to do. I try to be authentic and try to be
          original, so that's what I try to be. A lot of people try to build big
          brands but have received bad advice, and they don't try to be
          authentic and real with themselves."*

          # Our Mission


          Our mission is _**Helping business do the unfamiliar**_. 



          ### Why are we helping

          We love to learn and use our cognitive abilities in order to meet our
          needs to grow as people. One could say that our our motivation sits
          right at the top of [Maslow's hierarchy of
          needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).
          We find that one of the best ways to achieve this, is by helping
          others turn the different and strange into the normal and ordinary. 


          When we say that we _**"help business do the unfamiliar"**_. We mean
          we want to enable our clients to do the job. That we assit in analysis
          of the situation, identification of the problem and implementation of
          the solution, but we're not the ones that continuouly performing job
          after that. This is why we say we help our clients by joining and
          guiding them through their journey of turning their challanges into
          their new business as usual.


          > _"When the world changes and becomes strange, those who were
          previously outside the standards of normality will have an opportunity
          to become successful."

          > - **Hunter S. Thompson**


          ### Who are we helping

          Our target clients is business and organizations that are highly
          specialized, facing unfamiliar situations, or just need a outsider
          perspective.  


          We think that most business are rigged to their own normalcy. They
          have over time specialized their organization, people, processes and
          culture to create a normalzy that is optimized and incrementally
          enhanced for generating value for their customers within their niche.
          I.e. their strenght lay in being rigged to do the same thing in a
          consisten and continiual manner. 


          Such organizations often attracts people that like the opportunities
          of specialization or predictability they can offer. The trade-off such
          organization often accept is that they become less flexible, adaptable
          and agile. This due to the inertia created by their mindsets, ways of
          working and earlier commitments and capital investments. 


          > *“The world rewards specialization, but- specialization comes at a
          cost. You learn more and more about less and less until you know
          everything about nothing.”* 

          > - **Nathan Myhrvold**, once called “the smartest man he knew” by
          Bill Gates


          ### How are we helping

          We love new challanges and we know how to face the unknown, unfamiliar
          and stange. 


          We know that just because something is new to you, doesn't mean it new
          to everyone. We help our clients by assiting them in the search for
          what their problem truely is, finding who has solve the problem in the
          past and how they did it, and in the end helping them address it in
          their organization themselves. 


          We stive to make our clients independent of us. _Give a man a fish and
          you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a
          lifetime._ If we done the job right, they will come back to us when
          the environment necessitates that fishing must be supplimented by
          hunting.

          > *“Favoring specialization over intelligence is exactly wrong,
          especially in high tech. The world is changing so fast across every
          industry and endeavor that it's a given the role for which you're
          hiring is going to change. Yesterday's widget will be obsolete
          tomorrow, and hiring a specialist in such a dynamic environment can
          backfire. A specialist brings an inherent bias to solving problems
          that spawns from the very expertise that is his putative advantage,
          and may be threatened by a new type of solution that requires new
          expertise. A smart generalist doesn't have bias, so is free to survey
          the wide range of solutions and gravitate to the best one.”*

          Company values - also called compan, corporate or core values - are
          the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help our
          people function together as a team and work toward a our common
          business goal of helping our clients.



          ### Act with **Integrity**


          > *“As I have said, the first thing is to be honest with yourself. You
          can never have an impact on society if you have not changed yourself.
          Great peacemakers are all people of integrity, of honesty, but
          humility.”**

          > - **Nelson Mandela**



          ### Take **Ownership**

          > *"What you resist, persists. If you take ownership and deal with
          things that are bothering you, then, in the very process of dealing
          with them they very often will go away."**

          > - **Anonymous**


          ### **Dive Deep** in to matter

          > *“Although this was not a comforting point of view, he did not
          reject it, because it coincided with one of his basic beliefs: that a
          man must at all costs keep some part of himself outside and beyond
          life. If he should ever for an instant cease doubting, accept wholly
          the truth of what his senses conveyed to him, he would be dislodged
          from the solid ground to which he clung and swept along with the
          current, having lost all objective sense, totally involved with
          existence.”*

          > - **Paul Bowles**, The Spider's House


          ### Be **Curious** to all things

          > *“Why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man
          immediately needs to know what's on the other side?”*

          > - **George R.R. Martin**, A Game of Thrones


          ### **Inspire** greathness in others

          > *“Unleash the potential that is in another and you unleash the
          potential that is in you.”*

          > - **Matshona Dhliwayo**


          ### Be nice to **People**

          strength.”*

          # UX Reseach, Analysis & Design


          User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create
          products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.
          This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and
          integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design,
          usability and function.


          UX design covers a vast array of areas and has different meanings for
          differnet people, so before we start let's take a recap what UX Design
          is.


          ### What is UX anyways?


          When asking what UX is? Many people answer me that UX is some form of
          what the UX Designers here do. Which, when diving deeper, is usually
          some subset of UX tasks or pure User Interface, Visual or Graphical
          Design. Inconsitencies in what UX Design Roles are further adds to the
          confusion.


          A UX designer - to us - is concerned with the entire process of
          acquiring and integrating a product, including aspects of branding,
          design, usability and function. It is a story that begins before the
          device is even in the user’s hands.



          > *“No product is an island. A product is more than the product. It is
          a cohesive, integrated set of experiences. Think through all of the
          stages of a product or service – from initial intentions through final
          reflections, from first usage to help, service, and maintenance. Make
          them all work together seamlessly.”*

          > - **Don Norman**, inventor of the term “User Experience”


          Products that provide great user experience (e.g., the iPhone) are
          thus designed with not only the product’s consumption or use in mind
          but also the entire process of acquiring, owning and even
          troubleshooting it.


          ![The Why, What and How of UX
          Design](https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/3c7d938af5ab0d5e6ac67be9536e3c47.jpeg)

          **Image:** The Why, What and How of UX Design


          A UX designer should consider the Why, What and How of product use.
          The Why involves the users’ motivations for adopting a product,
          whether they relate to a task they wish to perform with it or to
          values and views which users associate with the ownership and use of
          the product. The What addresses the things people can do with a
          product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of
          functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX
          designers start with the Why before determining the What and then,
          finally, the How in order to create products that users can form
          meaningful experiences with.



          UX design is a multidisciplinary field and process that encompasses
          the entire user journey.  Typical UX designer tasks vary, but often
          include user research, creating personas, designing wireframes and
          interactive prototypes as well as testing designs. These tasks vary
          from one team to the next, but they always demand designers to be the
          users’ advocate and keep the users’ needs at the center of all design
          and development efforts. 


          That’s also why most UX designers work in some form of user-centered
          work process, and keep refining their best-informed efforts until they

          an understanding of the users and their context as a starting point
          for all design and development.



          ### Our UX Research, Analysis & Design Services


          Our *UX Research, Analysis* & *Design* services focus on all aspects
          of product development with the perspective of the products full life
          cylce - from cradle to grave - from the perspeltive of the individual
          or group using the product.


          *Product development* is hard, and the hardest - and most important -
          is identifying the products target and the problem it will address.
          User research and analysis in combination with deep understanding of
          the problem the user have - including how competitors fail or succeed
          at addressing them - is key to developing a product that is a simple
          solution to a significant problem rather then one that is a great
          solution to a insignificant problem.

          and execute the product development methodologies and techniques that
          best suits your company, product, culture, team and risk.

          Business Analysis is the practice of enabling change in an
          organizational context, by defining needs and recommending solutions
          that deliver value to stakeholders.


          ### What is Business Analysis & Research anyways?

          Job titles for *business analysis practitioners* include not only
          *business analyst*, but also *business systems analyst, systems
          analyst, requirements engineer, process analyst, product manager,
          product owner, enterprise analyst, business architect, management
          consultant, business intelligence analyst, data scientist*, etc. The
          same can also be said for a *UX Desigers* and *Market Analyst*. All
          these professions, including management, *project management, product
          management, software development, quality assurance and interaction
          design* rely heavily on the same analysis and research tools,
          techniques, methodologies and skills for success. Although a *Business
          Analyst*, *Market Analyst* and *User Analyst (UX Designer)* have
          different priorities and objectives - and may argue hows techniques
          and methodolgies it is - the job analysis and research are performed
          in much the same way.


          Business analysis is used to identify and articulate the need for
          change in how organizations work, and to facilitate that change. The
          business analysts identify and define the solutions that will maximize
          the value delivered by an organization to its stakeholders. This
          requires work across all levels of an organization and may involve
          everything from defining strategy, to creating the enterprise
          architecture, to taking leaderships role by defining the goals and
          requirements for programs and projects or supporting continuous
          improvement in its technology and processes.


          In short, Business Analysis is a disciplined approach for introducing
          and managing change to organizations.


          ### The Value Business Analysis & Research

          According to [PMI’s Pulse of the
          Profession](https://www.pmi.org/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/core-competency-project-program-success)
          47% of unsuccessful projects fail to meet original goals due to poor
          requirements

          management. In the another [Pulse
          Report](https://www.pmi.org/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pulse-of-the-profession-2017)
          39% of failed projects identify inaccurate requirements gathering as a
          primary cause of failure. It further found that those organizations
          that demonstrate maturity in business analysis practices are 55% more
          successful in implementing strategy and are much more likely to
          achieve the expected value from the investments made on programs and
          projects. 


          Organizations that follow mature business analysis practices will
          deliver better results and do so more efficiently and effectively than
          peer organizations with immature practices.


          Organizations are often tempted to provide solutions before fully
          understanding a situation. Business analysis enables the organization
          to identify and fix the root causes of problems instead of repeatedly
          addressing symptoms as they occur.


          * People

          * Culture

          * Process


          #### Managing Risk and Reducing Rework

          What constitutes sufficient business analysis is dependent on the risk
          appetite of the organization and the level of confidence required
          before the organization is comfortable proceeding with its
          initiatives. The decision to proceed without performing sufficient
          business analysis and accepting a higher level of uncertainty is often
          the result of undervaluing business analysis activities. Although
          business analysis requires considerable time and resources, if
          overlooked, it can result in insufficiently understood requirements,
          missed stakeholder expectations, and frustration

          on the part of the project team and other key stakeholders. These
          issues can lead to much rework and many requests for change. It may
          seem counterintuitive, but taking the time to conduct business
          analysis actually saves time, reduces costs, and minimizes risk
          exposure in the long run.



          #### Effects of Product Defects

          When insufficient time is allocated to business analysis activities,
          gaps in requirements can arise. Missing and misunderstood requirements
          can lead to product defects. Product defects uncovered within the
          confines of the project

          result in rework, but if these product defects are uncovered once a
          product is released to the consumer, the results are exponentially
          worse.

          In today’s competitive business world, you need steady and experienced
          management to guide your strategies. *Product Management* and
          *Project, Program & Portfolio Management* are very important and
          complimantary domains that - yet distinct - are often interchangeably
          confused by all levels of business executives.


          We provide advisory services to help you tailor your *Governance* for
          *Product, Project, Program or Portfolio* to meet requirements for your
          organization. Our advisors will join and help you to tailor, implement
          and socialize the methodologies - from predictive to agile - that best
          suits your company, product, culture, team and risk.


          ### Predictive vs. Agile

          Agile and waterfall are two distinctive methodologies of processes to
          complete projects or work items. Agile is an iterative methodology
          that incorporates a cyclic and collaborative process. Waterfall is a
          sequential methodology that can also be collaborative, but tasks are
          generally handled in a more linear process.


          Following the agile methodology, your project will move through a
          series of cycles throughout the lifetime of the project. The
          development phase, review, feedback, and then approval of the work
          item – either yes or no. If yes, implement and complete the task. If
          no, record and make any necessary changes, track and adjust the
          backlog or prioritization to reflect the newly acquired knowledge, and
          then move onto the next task or sprint.


          Following the waterfall methodology is a simpler process of moving
          tasks through the phases of defining requirements, designing the
          implementation, implementing the work item, verification of
          implementation and quality assurance, and then maintenance of the
          feature in the end.


          Selecting the right methodology for your projects will depend on
          preference and the nature of each project. The answer is rarely either
          pure Waterfall or pure Agile. Some projects require a more iterative
          process and others require a more sequential approach. 



          ### Standards from the Project Management Institute


          Our advisors are knowledgeable and certified by [Project Management
          Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) in their domain. The company has by

          Program and Portfolio Management* as they fit the companys profile of
          being tailorable (to the individual ned), broad (generalized to meet
          most needs) and guidelines (advisory) based. This does however not
          mean that we limit our selves to them and ignore the lessons from
          competing standars and frameworks.

          _Facilitation_ is a set of skills used in working with a group to
          enable and support them to achieve their objectives. This in a way
          that involves all participants, respects all contributions, builds
          ownership and releases the potential of the group and its members. 


          _Coaching_ is a set of skills used in working with a individual to
          enable and support them to achieve their objectives. It's about
          supporting a person at every level in becoming who they want to be.


          Our advisors are experienced with the tools and techniques of both
          _coaching_ and _facilitation_. They can help you or your team builds
          awareness and empowers choices that lead to the changes necessary to

          ### Facilitation


          Facilitation is a set of skills to be used in working with a group,
          enabling and supporting them to achieve their objectives in a way that
          involves and respects all contributions, builds ownership and releases
          the potential of the group and its members. It helps differentiate
          between process and content.


          You don’t have to be a “facilitator” in order to use facilitation
          methods and techniques. Many managers, elected and appointed leaders,
          educators, IT workers, researchers, consultants, etc. draw on the
          values, principles and practices of facilitation to engage more
          effectively and enrich the experience of colleagues, students,
          clients, participants.

          ### Coaching


          Coaching is a process that aims to improve performance and focuses on
          the ‘*here and now*’ rather than on the distant past or future.


          * coach as expert

          * coach as a facilitator of learning


          There is a huge difference between teaching someone and helping them
          to learn. In coaching, fundamentally, the coach is helping the
          individual to improve their own performance: in other words, helping
          them to learn.


          * To help a person change in the way they wish and helping them go in
          the direction they want to go.

          * Coaching supports a person at every level in becoming who they want
          to be.

          * Coaching builds awareness empowers choice and leads to change.


          #### Not Coaching


          **Consultancy**

          A consultant provides expertise and solves business problems, or
          develops a business as a whole. A consultant deals with the overall
          organization or specific parts of it and not individuals within it.
          Consultants only indirectly affect individuals.


          **Teaching**

          Teaching passes knowledge from teacher to student. The teacher knows
          something the student does not. The opposite is true in coaching. The
          client is the expert and the client has the answers, not the coach.


          **Training**

          Training is the process of getting knowledge skills or abilities by
          study, experience or teaching. The trainer by definition is the
          expert, and the training course is likely to be targeted on specific
          skills for immediate results. Training is also likely to be one to
          many rather than one to one.


          **Therapy**

          Therapy is working with the client who seeks relief from psychological
          or physical symptoms. The client wants emotional healing and relief
          from mental pain. Therapy deals with the client’s mental health.
          Coaching deals with the client’s mental growth. The client’s motive
          for entering therapy or counseling is usually to get away from pain or
          discomfort, rather than moving towards desired goals. Coaching is not
          remedial, it is generative. Both therapy and counseling are more
          likely to involve understanding and working with past experience than
          coaching.


          **Counseling**

          Counseling is working with a client who feels uncomfortable, or
          dissatisfied with their life. They are seeking guidance and advice. A
          counselor works remedially on a client’s problem.


          **Mentoring**

          Mentoring is when a senior colleague, seen as more knowledgeable and
          worldly wise gives advice and provides a role model. Mentoring
          involves wide ranging discussions that may not be limited to the work
          context. A mentor is a sponsor with great professional experience in
          their client’s field of work. Both mentoring and coaching are
          concerned mainly with achievements in the present and the future.

          ### Introduction

          Development, Business Strategy, Change Management* and more. Common to

          tactics in the middle, and actions at the base. **Ideas a cheap,
          execution is everything.** A strategy is nothing without tactics and
          action to make it realize them.


          In this first article in the series, we will discuss the value of
          analysis and discuss what you should consider before starting a
          analysis. In the next article we will provide an introduction to the
          Strategic Pyramid model. Then break down each stage, before conluding.

          ### The Value of Analysis

          Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel, states in his book [*High Output
          Management*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324750.High_Output_Management)
          that the value of a report is not created in it's consumption, but
          rather it's creation. When writing a report, or performing a analysis,
          the details are checked and any logical inconsistencies uncovered are
          addressed. So the simple answer to why it is important is:
          **validation**. *External* validation of you, your company to existing
          and potential customers, and more importantly *internal* validation to
          youself and endevours members.


          In short

          * it can save you and your team time by catching problems while they
          are small.

          * it can unlock new insight, that either increases the value of the
          endevour or kills it before resources is wasted persueing it.

          * it can save team frustration and improve performance, by having a
          clear end goal of what is to be accomplished. 

          * it can save cost by reducing rework.


          ### Consideration for Weather Analysis is for You

          Is it always good to perform a deep and through analysis? The short
          answer for this question is NO. While doing a deep and through
          analysis can give you a clear direction, it  


          There is many factors that comes into play:

          * What is your teams maturity? 

          * What is the caracteristics of your endevour?

          * Who is the endevours benefactors?

          * What is the endevours scope?

          * What is the competitive state?



          ##### Team Maturity

          A thorough analysis requires disciplined and structured approach. This
          may require that established truths and cultural norms established in
          the team are challanged. Your teams maturity working in this manner
          and acceptance of encroachment of what's holy to them is imperative
          for accomplishing the desired outcome. It is also important that once
          the result of a analysis is completed that the team accepts lives by
          the accompanying action plan (even though they still may not agree).


          If there is strong doubt about the teams ability to do this, then
          outside help may maybe considered or a more agile and iterative
          approach may be applicable.


          > *"A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no
          solution at all: solve the correct problem.”*

          > - **Donald A. Normal**, The Design of Everyday Things


          ##### The Characteristics of What You Offer

          Is your endevour specialized or generalized? Specialized products,
          services and companies have a very clear purpose: *"To make money
          doing the thing only they know."* I.e. for those who need their
          products or services, it's not difficult to understand how they
          compare to others.


          Generic products, like bottled water or vodka, have by defintion
          essitional the same physical properties. The only differentiating
          factor for such products is the products perception in the customers
          mind. In the first case, a thourgh analysis won't make much
          difference, but for the other it's essential.


          How about services? Where does freelancers and consultants fall into
          this landscape? People are different, but jobs often the same. If you
          are a developer specialized in a given ERP solution, your knowledge
          and skillset is highly specialized. If you are primarilly working with
          people, such as in Project/Product Management, Business Analysis, or
          UX design, then your knowledge and skillset is usally generalized.


          ##### The Endevours Benefactors

          If your buyers are large industrial companies with institusionalized
          purchasing departments, there is mainly one questions they needed to
          know the answer to: *"Does your products and services save us money or
          help us make more?"* They may communicate they want to build or
          maintain long term relatiionships, but this isn't always communicated
          to the pruchasing department nor in line with their success criteria.
          In that case, building a good narrative may have limited value. 


          If your buyers are private consumers or individual decision makers,
          they can be significantly more influenced by a brand image, good
          story, and presentation. The *"Why"* of what you offer then be the 


          > **The Buyers vs The Users** 

          >

          > We differentiate here between *the buyers* - the people with
          authority to sign the contract - and *the users* or *the client* - the
          people who use the proudcts or services. Their preferences may not be
          the same.



          ### Consideration Before Starting a Analysis


          There is many considerations you should take before starting. We'll go
          through a few of these here.


          ##### Analysis Participants


          When starting a strategic pyramid analysis it's important to remember
          that it's a team effort. People have different values and
          perspectives. Choosing the right people - either as participants or as
          information sources - is important to ensure that the result of the
          analysis truely reflects the wider team.


          If you are a solo freelancer without a team, use the people close to
          you (and they'll be glad to help).


          ##### Descision Making

          The processes and techniques described in this series promoto the use
          of consensus as a descision making technique. Where not possible,
          people in western countries will tend default for a more democratic
          technique such as majority rule. Most businesses are neither
          democratic nor consensus based, they are totalitarian with one person
          being the final decision maker. Experience tells us that if the team
          comes to a conclusion that the descision maker does not fully support,
          then the work will shift to his original idea after some time. It's
          better to give *The Decider* the veto power from the start.


          > **The Decider**

          >

          > If *The Decider* is given veto power and final say, it's very
          important that all participants give their opinions, input and votes
          before *The Decider* shows their cards. The workshop's foucs is then
          to broaden and influence *The Decider* perspective and opinion.


          ##### External Help

          It can be tempting to use external help to perform such a analysis.
          Particularly when the team is not familiar with the such analysis
          work. It does however depend on the short versus long term objective. 


          In the long run your team will be stronger by having the competence
          and capability itself. It will give your analyst *skin in the game* -
          and the associated scars - by having to live with outcome of both the
          analysis and the endevour. Aquiring this competence will take time and
          effort, but it will payout in the long run. 


          Endevours often have short term constraints that limits the teams
          ability to aquire the competence themselves. In such situations, you
          should first check if an external facilitator is acceptable. This puts
          the responsibility of the analysis on the team, but outsiders help
          with setting the framework. 


          If a facilitator is used, then it is especially important that they
          are exactly that, a facilitator (and a coach). If they also perform
          the analysis you will lose ownership to the process in the long run.


          When time is really pressing, it may be beneficial to have a external
          analyst perform the analysis. Situations do accure when this is the
          best option, but one should be very carefull. 



          There is also other situations where using external help for the
          analysis is beneficial? Sometimes you actually want a fancy, flashy
          and shallow analysis which you have no intention on following up on.
          E.g. When you have a product that is highly specialized and sell on
          merit and value alone, but it's a pre-requesite for complaiance,
          marketing or to be taken serious by certain stakeholders (such as
          investors, customers, employees, competitors, the public, etc.) a
          shallow analysis may be just what you need. In such cases using a
          external analyst may be just what the doctor ordered.


          There is also the situation where you want to train a internal
          resourse to do the role, but want a experienced resource to bring them
          quickly up to speed. 


          > **Management Consulting**

          >

          > The _Strategic Pyramid_ is a favourite amoung *Management
          Consultants*, and as with much of their work, it's often something
          that is percieved as fancy, flashy and shallow rather than something
          that is actually usefull or lived by. Even though it has a bad
          reputation - most often due to lack of ownership in the recieving
          organization - but done right it can act as a strong power amplifier.

          >

          > *Mangement Consultants* and *Professional* that specialize in these
          types of analysis is in fact very experienced and knowledgeable. So,
          why shouldn't you use external help? It's all about having "*skin in
          the game*". Firstly, while they are experienced at the analysis, but
          they are rarely experienced at the execution in the context of your
          endevour. Secondly, their incentives does not always align with the
          company's objectives. 

          >

          > A internal resource that owns the process and analysis will have to
          live with the consequences throughout it's execution and life span. He
          will - over time - have the knowledged about the unique minute details
          about the companys culture and ways of working that can makes the
          difference between success and failure.

          Pyramid Analysis. The intended audience for this article series on
          _Strategic Pyramid Analysis_ are freelancers, teams, product managers
          & owners, business analyst, project & program managers, entrepenurs or

          The objective of this article series is to provide actionable
          recommendations for how to perform a such a analysis and establish
          whether such a analysis is suitable for you. 



          The objective of this article is to provide a introduction to what
          Strategic Pyramid is.


          ### Introduction


          ![Strategic
          Pyramid](/assets/img/pub/values-vision-mission-objectives-explained.png) 

          **Figure 1:** Strategic Pyramid


          The strategic pyramid, or strategic management pyramid, comes in many
          forms. What is common for them all is that is starts with the
          aspirational level at top with focus on the core belifs of the
          endevour. It further expands down to the achievable level defining the
          direction and identity. And in the end lands at the specific and
          tangable level actionable short.


          >**A few words on Terminology**

          >

          > _Strategic Pyramid Analysis_ is most commonly associated in the use
          of a business or brand, but it's also applicable for ideal
          organizations, products or services, brands, individual persons that
          is endevouring to do something. This means different wordings are used
          to discribe the same concepts based on with context one is in.

          > 

          > The definition of **_endevour_** as a verb is *"try hard to do or
          achieve something"* and as noun a *"an attempt to achieve a goal"*.
          And we'll use this term to describe the undertaking in this series. 

          > 

          > The endevours participants can also have many forms, such as
          employees, team or individual, we'll accordingly use the term
          **_member_** to describe these (def. *"a person, animal, or plant
          belonging to a particular group"*).


          ### Values

          The values are the ethics, beliefs, philosophies, and principles that
          drive your endevour. It's quite simply what does the endevour stand
          for?


          Having clear values for your endevour is the first step to ensure that
          all the endevours members and stakeholders are working towards the
          same goals. This  doesn't mean having a polished communication plan
          around nice values and principles. To benefit from them it's necessary
          to truly honor the  endevour values in everything it does and for the
          leadership to set the right example for it's members and stakeholders.
          Every decision for the endevours should strive to aligne with these
          values. It's the only then they can work as a way can build lasting
          trust.


          The core values further supports the endevours vision and mission in
          forming its culture. 



          ### Vision

          The endevours vision describes the desired long-term results of it's
          efforts. It describes the where of the endevour. It is the inspiration
          and guide for the endevour's members, e.g. the company's employees or
          the product team, but can also to other stakeholders. The vision
          should motivate the members to make a difference and be part of
          something bigger than themselves.


          ### Mission

          The endevours mission are based in the present and designed to convey
          to both members and stakeholders of the endevour why the it exists,
          what it does and  who it does for.


          The mission is used by the endevour to explain, in simple and concise
          terms, its purpose for being. It is generally short, either a single
          sentence or a short paragraph.


          The big difference between the vision and the mission is that the
          first is aspirational and the latter is actionable.


          ### Strategic Objectives

          Strategic objectives are the big-picture goals for the endevour. They
          describe what the endevour will do to try to fulfill its mission.
          Strategic objectives are usually some sort of performance goal—for
          example, to launch a new product, increase profitability, or grow
          market share for the product.


          The strategic objectives define:

          * How are we goint to progress?

          * Which pains are we addressing?

          * What goals do we want to achieve?

          * In what order are we going to do it?


          The key word here is **prioritization** (i.e. *to arrange in order of
          importance so that you can deal with the most important things before
          the others:*).


          ### Actions & Metrics


          The actions and metrics define:

          * What do we have to do?

          * When do we have to do them?

          * What resources do we need to accomplish them?

          * Who owns the things we do?

          * How do we know when they are complete?

          > **The Rise of a Purpose Statement**

          >

          > The mission statement, vision, and values are traditionally the
          three most common descriptions of a business that explain why a
          company exists. In recent years, another type of statement has also
          emerged in the business world and is gaining more popularity. This
          type of statement is called a purpose statement.

          >

          > A purpose statement conveys a company’s reason for existence, just
          as the mission statement and vision do, but it also shows the
          connection between the brand identity and workplace culture of the
          company. It combines the components of a mission statement, vision,
          and values into a single statement.

          The values are the ethics, beliefs, philosophies, and principles that
          drive your endeavor. It's quite simply what does the endeavor stand
          for?


          Having clear values for your endeavor is the first step to ensure that
          all the endeavors members and stakeholders are working towards the
          same goals. This does not mean having a polished communication plan
          around nice values and principles. To truly benefit from defined
          values it is necessary to truly honor them in every part of the
          endeavor and for the leadership to set the right example for it's
          members and stakeholders. Every decision for the endeavors should
          strive to align with these values. It's the only then they can work as
          a way can building a strong culture.


          ### Defining the Endeavors Values


          A clear set of values, agreed and understood by leadership and
          following is often attributed to being the secret behind most
          successful organizations. If your endeavor is yet to establish a set
          of values the below process can help you to identify and develop them.
          One of the ways to establish the your endeavors values is by using the
          Double Diamond Method.

          >

          > The double diamond is based on the frame innovation approach coined
          by Kees Dorst, Professor of Design Innovation at the University of
          Technology. In his approach, the design process can be divided into
          problem space and solution space. The **problem space** is when
          designers explore the problem, including its complex nature, and end
          with a clear definition of the problem. It is where the majority of
          the unique design characteristics and value lay, including creativity
          and uncertainty. The **second stage** is the solution space, where
          ideas are generated, visualized, and tested prototypes. At the end of
          this stage, the final product is created and delivered to the
          end-user.

          ### Preparations


          Good preparations will increase the likelihood of a good outcome and
          reduce the collective time spent by the team. Time is money and
          committees can very time consuming. *Failing to plan, is planning to
          fail.*


          In order for the analysis work to be effective, the analyst should do
          the following preparations:

          * Participants

          * Introduction

          * Location


          ![Notes](/assets/img/stock/dylan-gillis-kdeqa3atnby-unsplash.jpg)

          **Image** Planning


          #### Participants

          Most endeavors are team efforts and people have different values,
          beliefs, perceptions and ethics. Selecting the participants for the
          analysis so the resulting values reflect something all the endeavors
          members can identify with is imperative for their adaption. 


          > **Affinity Bias**

          >

          > _Affinity bias, also known as similarity bias, is the tendency
          people have to connect with others who share similar interests,
          experiences and backgrounds. Affinity bias in the workplace: When
          companies hire for “culture fit,” they are likely falling prey to
          affinity bias._


          Affinity bias is deeply ingrained in the human condition. When
          starting a analysis it is only natural that we would like to do it
          with the people we normally work with and trust. This may however
          result in outcomes that will not appeal to the endeavors members as a
          whole. The *analyst* should take care to include the people they
          normally do not work with or people that they do not like working
          with. If you can come to an agreement with them, the likelihood of
          getting something all can agree on is much higher. 


          > **Confirmation Bias**

          >

          > _Confirmation bias is the inclination to draw conclusions about a
          situation or person based on your personal desires, beliefs and
          prejudices rather than on unbiased merit._


          The importance of validating and testing your analysis method or
          output is even more important when you are without a team.
          Confirmation bias is a real and can result in outcomes that does not
          meet the endeavors benefactors needs. In such cases, using the lessons
          of [The Lean Startup Methodology](http://theleanstartup.com/) of
          always testing and validating is essential. You can use the people
          close to you, potential customers or strangers. Or else you may fall
          victim to confirmation bias and lose a lot of perspective.


          #### Introduction


          The purpose of the *workshop introduction* is to set the stage for the
          participants. When the participants understand the why, when, how and
          what of the workshop they are more likely to feel more secure in
          expressing their opinions and thoughts. To facilitate this, the
          *analyst* and *facilitator* should jointly prepare the following
          presentation material:


          * The Workshop Objective - Why

          * The Workshop Agenda - When

          * The Methods - How

          * The Outcome - What


          The *analyst* should further prepare a selection of core values from
          offset endeavors. The participants familiarity with core values and
          how they are presented may differ. Having some examples can really
          help in their understanding of the task and also provide inspiration.


          When looking for offsets, the *analyst* should follow good
          benchmarking practice and not just look at endeavors that do the same
          as them, but also endeavors that is generally recognized for their
          excellence in the field. 


          >**Example Themes**

          >* Business growth

          >* Business associates

          >* Work

          >* Customer service

          >* Decision making

          >* Teamwork

          >* Leadership

          >* Business improvement

          >* Staff

          >* Market identity

          >* Financial material

          >* Social community

          >* Environmental sustainability


          The *analyst* should further prepare prepare a list themes - see
          examples about - and provide this to the *facilitator*. During the
          workshop introduction, the *facilitator* should ask the participants
          to reflect on each of the following questions for each of the selected
          themes. 


          * What principles and values come to mind when you think of each
          theme?

          * Why is each value you list important to you?

          * What influence does it have on the way you approach or manage the
          endeavor?


          The *analyst* should prepare for the workshop by providing a list of
          categories they think is most relevant for the endeavor.


          In summary the _**Introduction Agenda**_ will be the following:

          * The Workshop Objective - Why

          * The Workshop Agenda - When

          * The Methods - How

          * The Outcome - What

          * Offset Examples

          * Reflective Themes & Questions



          #### Location

          The *analyst* and *facilitator* should find a location for the
          workshops. It should take be a comfortable place that have enough
          empty wall pace or a target whiteboard. This beneficial because of two
          main reasons: 

          1. There will be many brainstorming drafts and sticky notes to
          visualize in front of the team through the process to keep in mind all
          the aspects of the design challenge at hand

          2. Returning to the meeting room every morning and review the work
          done ensures the focus and continuity of the ideas as the team move
          from one step to another. 


          The location should be prepared with:

          * Post-it notes

          * Markers

          * Stickers

          * Whiteboard


          Distractions


          ### Workshop


          The *discover* and *define* phase of the *problem space* in the
          *double diamond process* will be executed as part of a workshop.



          ![Chess
          Pieces](/assets/img/stock/jeshoots-com-fzoitus1diq-unsplash.jpg)

          **Image:** Chess Pieces


          #### Roles

          The process will divide the effort and responsibility to the following
          roles:

          * **Analyst** - The analyst is the person who analyses and documents
          the process.  

          * **Facilitator** - The facilitator plans, guides and manages a group
          event to meet its goals.

          * **Participants** - The persons who takes part in the analysis
          effort.

          * **Decider** - The person with authority to make decisions.


          The *analyst* and *facilitator* may often be the same person. It is
          also not uncommon for the analyst to be a *participant* or *decider*.
          It is generally recommended to have the roles separated in a workshop
          setting. This is primarily lessen the load on a single individual and
          allowing them to only perform their own role. Having one person
          perform several roles also reduces their ability to manage the bias
          associated with that role.



          > **Anchor Bias**

          >

          > _Anchor bias or expectation anchor bias is when someone holds onto
          an initial, singular piece of information to make decisions._


          The analyst can be strongly influenced based on the their preparatory
          efforts. The other roles may also be locked by their initial starting
          point. This can in particular be a challenge when that initial
          starting point was not based in reason. _"You cannot reason someone
          out of something he or she was not reasoned into."_


          > **Authority Bias**

          >

          > _Authority bias refers to when an idea or opinion is given more
          attention or thought to be more accurate because it was provided by an
          authority figure._


          The *facilitator* and *decider* both have an authority role in the
          workshop and may generate a authority bias within the group. When a
          workshop group consists of participants of different authority level -
          e.g. top leadership and on the floor workers - the opinions of the
          participants at the top may strongly influence those of the bottom.


          > **Nonverbal Bias**

          >

          > _Nonverbal bias is analyzing nonverbal communication attributes such
          as body language and letting it affect a decision or opinion._


          The *facilitator* can strongly influence the participants in how they
          structure the discussions and workshop. 


          Both *analyst*, *decider* and *facilitator* should consider their body
          language towards the participants during a workshop. Even if they do
          not say anything, the body language may contribute to shifting the
          groups opinions in their desired direction. 


          ![](/assets/img/stock/leon-vbxyfxlgpjm-unsplash.jpg)


          #### Workshop Stages


          The workshop agenda will be:


          * Part 1 - Introduction

          * Part 2 - Silent Brainstorm 

          * Part 3 - Silent Review

          * Part 5 - Silent Grouping

          * Part 6 - Open Review

          * Part 7 - Prioritization

          * Part 8 - Reflection


          ##### Part 1 - Introduction


          The facilitator is responsible for doing the introductory
          presentation.


          **Introduction Agenda:**

          * The Workshop Objective - Why

          * The Workshop Agenda - When

          * The Methods - How

          * The Outcome - What

          * Offset Examples

          * Reflective Themes & Questions



          It is customary to allow a short break of 10-15 minutes after the
          introduction before starting the next phase.


          ##### Part 2 - Silent Brainstorm

          The first part in the *double diamond process*  is the *discovery* and
          *divergence* phase of the *problem space*.  


          The objective of the silent brainstorm is to get as many relevant
          values as possible from the group. The silence of the brainstorm is a
          important step in creating divergence by emphasizing *individual*
          contributions. It also effectively prevents cooperation and group
          thinking and thus reduce **authority** and **nonverbal bias** among
          the participants as a group.


          The first step in a silent brainstorm is for the *facilitator* to hand
          out a block sticky-note and a pen to each participant. All the
          participants should get the same color sticky notes and pens. Filt tip
          pens with a broad stroke is preferred for readability when place on a
          wall.


          The *facilitator* should then instruct the participants to write down
          as many values or themes within the given time-box. The *facilitator*
          should further reassure the participants that it is no right or wrong
          way of defining the values. Some people think more in terms of
          actions, scenarios, situations or events that reflect a value. This is
          acceptable and is valid input for later refinement.


          Once the instructions is provided and the tools handed out, the
          *facilitator* should start the time-box count down. A 2 to 5 minute
          time box is usually sufficient.


          If the participants are inexperienced with the silent brainstorming
          technique, the participants may return only a few results. In this
          case, it may be helpful for the *facilitator* to use some of the
          offset values presented in the introduction as a supplement. These
          should be prepared before the session starts and be clearly marked
          that they wasn't part of the teams effort. The best way is to use a
          sticky-note of a different color.


          ![Offset Values Example](/assets/img/pub/values-offset-example.png
          "Example offset values - No duplicates")

          **Image:** Example offset values


          ##### Part 3 - Silent Review

          We continue the *discovery* and *divergence* phase by allowing each
          participant to become aware of the others perspective.


          The *facilitator* will now ask the *participants* to take their
          sticky-notes and put them on the wall. Usually, people tend to put
          their own notes grouped together, but there is no rule as to where
          they are placed. 


          When all the sticky-notes have been placed, the *facilitator* will ask
          the participants spend the next time-boxed amount to review each
          others values. A time-box of  3-5 minutes is usually sufficient, but
          there is not a hard time limit for this stage. The *participants*
          should be given sufficient time to take in the information.


          If the *facilitator* see there is few suggestions, this is the time to
          add the supplement values from the introduction. It's best to let the
          participants first to review their own before placing the prepared
          ones.


          The *facilitator* should document the placement of the notes. E.g. by
          taking a picture or if the exercise is performed online the
          *facilitator* should take a screenshot.


          ![Values Example - No
          duplicates](/assets/img/pub/values-silent-brainstorm-example1.jpg
          "Example Values - No duplicates")

          **Image:** Example values for Silent Review


          ##### Part 4 - Silent Grouping

          We now move out of the *discovery* and *divergence* phase, and start
          the *define* and *convergence* phase of the *problem space* in the
          *double diamond process*. We continue to take the of effect that
          authority and nonverbal bias can have on the participants thoughts,
          opinions and ideas into account and thus continue the workshop in
          silent mode. 


          The *facilitator* should now introduce the *silent grouping method* to
          the *participants*. The silent grouping is simply letting the
          participants move the values together without being allowed to speak
          to each other. Everybody has the right to move a sticky-note and put
          it where they think it belongs. A sticky-note can be moved several
          times. The exercise does not have a time-box and is finished once the
          group stops moving the sticky-notes.


          After the *participants* have grouped together the different items,
          the *facilitator* should review and think of a common theme for the
          different groups. The *facilitator* should however not share this view
          until after the open review.


          The *facilitator* should take a picture of the whiteboard or wall at
          this stage to document the teams result.


          As this concludes the silent part of the workshop it is a good time to
          the participants to have a break. This will give them time to reflect
          on what they have seen and done. It is also good opportunity for the
          participants to get to know each other better. Letting the workshop be
          a arena that foster psychological safety and trust in the group is
          important for capturing the diversity value of the group. A 15 minute
          break is good if the participants don't know each other well, but it
          can be shorter for teams that know each other well.  


          ![Silently Grouped

          Values after Silent Grouping - No duplicates")

          **Image:** Silent Grouping with facilitator note


          ##### Part 5 - Open Review

          In this stage we change the focus from individual contributions and
          will embrace techniques to emphasize group thinking. The desired
          result of these techniques is that each individual shall feel like
          they have contributed to the groups outcome and thus have a stake in
          it. This does not mean that they as an individuals total agree with
          the outcome, but they should think that the outcome is whats for the
          best of the group and endeavor. I.e. we are trying to take advantage
          of *conformity bias* in a controlled manner.


          > **Conformity bias**

          >

          > *Conformity bias is the tendency people have to act similar to the
          people around them regardless of their own personal beliefs or
          idiosyncrasies — also known as peer pressure.*


          The participants will now get the chance to explain or ask questions
          about what people meant about the stickies. The facilitator should
          also ask the group what their reasoning about the grouping was and if
          everybody agrees with the explanation provided. The facilitator should
          then present the teams they found among the values and listen to the
          teams assessment of the evaluation. The facilitator should then help
          the team define the themes of their groupings. 


          * What is this value about?

          * What do you really mean by it?

          * Do think people outside this room will understand it the same way?

          * Will your benefactors or stakeholders understand it?

          * What assumptions are behind this value? 

          * What other words, ideas or mental images do you associate with this
          value?


          The sticky-notes is the property of the *analyst*. If there is a lot
          of duplicates, this could be a good opportunity to remove them from
          the wall. For sake of traceability use a different color sticky-note
          and mark it with how many stickies it replaced.


          ##### Part 6 - Prioritization

          To prioritize and identify the values the team find most important,
          we'll start with the *dot voting technique*. Each participant will get
          a equal amount of small stickers each representing one vote. The
          participants are free to spend their votes as they please. This
          includes not spending them, as well as using multiple votes for the
          same item. 


          The facilitator needs to evaluate how many stickers to give each
          participant based on  

          * the amount of values proposed

          * the desired amount of end values

          * how many iterations or eliminations rounds will be performed to come
          to the end result.

          If elimination is done over several rounds, then the facilitator can
          choose to let all sticky notes stay or remove the one not voted for.

          If the workshop have selected to use a all powerful *Decision maker*,
          then it's important that the decision put their vote down after all
          the other participants.


          ##### Part 7 - Reflection

          We have now narrowed down our values to workshop outcome. It's now
          time to reflect on both the outcome and the process so far. It is here
          important to give every participant the opportunity and safety to
          express themselves. The facilitator should let the participants speak
          freely about how they feel and think about the outcome first. To
          emphasize the psychological safety of the participants he should first
          let all the participants speak honestly, but stop the participants
          from criticizing each others reflection. 


          Once everybody have given their personal reflection, the floor is open
          to critic or further reflection based on what others have said.  


          This concludes this phase of the workshop, but it does not conclude
          the end of the reflection. The participants should now get some time
          to think about the outcome on their own. The time between the workshop
          and the follow-up session should at minimum be one week and include a
          period of leisure time (e.g. weekend). This is so the participants
          have time to reflect and let their subconscious can process the
          experience.  


          To help the participants reflect, the facilitator/analyst should send
          a copy of the materials/artifacts and let them know there will ge a
          follow-up session within a given time.


          >**Special Notes:**

          >

          >* Good dialog starters can be questions such as:
              * Do the participants agree with it? 
              * Was it what they imagined at the beginning?
          >* This is also a great time for the facilitator to solicit feedback
          for how they thought the exercise went and what can be done better in
          the future.

          >* If the workshop have selected to use a *decider*, the person should
          speak last.

          >* The participants may use the time between the workshop and review
          to dicuss the process and the outcome among themselves. The individual
          participants should be able to reflect in the manner that suits them
          best, so the facilitator should neither encourage nor discourage such
          behaviour. 



          ### Refinement


          The refinement phase reflects the *solution space* of the *double
          diamond process*.


          ##### Part 1 - Analysis

          During the workshop, the analyst have collected the
          artifacts/materials generated during the workshop and taken notes
          about the participants. It is now time for to analyze, reflect and
          find common themes and messages that reflect values the participants
          have generated and prioritized.


          The objective of the analysis is to apply a structured and unbiased
          look at the materials generated during the workshop. There is no one
          true way for how the analysis is performed as it's very dependent on
          the context, result and analyst preference. Some may prefer to do it
          as a solo effort and some as part of a group exercise. The main
          objective is to try and look at the material generated during the
          workshop to create a actionable outcome. This may be finding common
          themes or developing a example messages or stories that reflect the
          values of the group. 


          Depending on the requirements, the outcome may be


          * Just the single work values.

          * Messages or stories to convey context of the values.

          * Example behaviors in context of the company the shows them in
          effect.

          * Presentation materials to communicate it to others not part of the
          group.



          >**Special Notes:**

          >

          >* If someone have a combined role as analyst and participant, it may
          be may seem beneficial for the analyst that the session is recorded.
          This *observer effect* may however change how the participants behave
          during the workshop. Trusting a external analyst - i.e. outsider -
          with the recording may make the participants feel more secure with
          respect to the fear of group exclusion. The best outcome will however
          be when the analyst is an internal resource. 

          >* It's highly recommended to validate the outcome with the
          participants or decision maker during the analysis work. 


          ##### Part 2 - Refinement

          The refinement phase is a group activity with the objective of
          elaborating, validating and clarifying the outcome of the workshop and
          the analyst preparatory work.


          Refinement can take many forms, but some factors are the same. The
          format should be session based with a clear agenda and time box.
          Having a relative short session duration makes the participants focus
          on the important issues. The participants should have access to the
          work material between sessions (e.g. for asynchronous work or
          reflection). 


          Collaborative writing is one common method here. Done correctly, the
          work is documented as it is refined. Detailing the journey as it
          happens is a great way of displaying confidence to the end result as
          anyone can review the rationale behind the decisions made.


          There is two ways of collaborative writing sessions. Everybody writes
          or a single person writes. Both have advantages and disadvantages. 


          When everybody writes, people listen and talk less to each other. They
          may also focus on their individual little part and get excessive
          ownership to that part (i.e. source of conflict). The positive side is
          that everybody may feel they contribute and much more work is done at
          concurrently. 


          When a single person writes, everybody focus on the same item at the
          same time. A problem with this approach is that some people may feel
          they are left out (i.e. the least vocal of the group). The person
          directing the meeting will also have much stronger influence over the
          outcome. 


          Combining the two is also beneficial at times. The meetings will be a
          single person writes, but the participants have access to modify the
          content between meetings. 



          ##### Part 3 - Review

          Its time to perform the review. As some time has past and the
          participants have had time to reflect on the workshop, it's good
          practice to start the session by soliciting their thoughts and
          feedback before the analyst presents his findings. 


          The outcome of this meeting is one of three options:


          * **Decide:** The participants or decision maker is happy with the
          results and ready to commit.

          * **Iterate:** The participants or decision maker feel more confident
          with the process, but thinks it further investigation would be
          beneficial.

          * **Terminate:** The participants or decision maker do not see value
          in proceeding any further with the work.


          ##### Part 3 - Iterate

          Iteration would be to schedule a new workshop. As the participants are
          more familiar with the process and have already some thoughts about
          the outcome, the workshop can potentially be cut shorter. 


          A different possibility is that group decision can be more challenging
          to achieve because some of the individual participants may be more
          committed to their own ideas. 


          ##### Part 4 - Decide

          After the participants feel satisfied with the outcome, it is time to
          formally commit to them. 


          ### Conclusion


          Defining your values seems like a easy task, but it can be a very time
          consuming - and this expensive - activity. The endeavors values are
          the foundational building blocks for it's strategy. If done honestly
          and lived by, it's a valuable excessive that can help cement the
          endeavors culture and be a real long term competitive advantage. If
          not, it will only be virtue posturing and risk a culture the promotes
          dishonesty and short term gains.

          A common mission can help your endeavor increase participants
          engagement and work towards a common goal


          ### What you communicate outwards and inwards?


          From ping-pong tables in the office to Google's bike meetings, it
          seems companies everywhere are trying to adopt incentives to build a
          successful business environment. These incentives, while they may seem
          great on the surface, have not been proven to retain and engage
          employees. A successful company culture starts with a defined,
          tangible mission.


          > *It is fundamental to set the tone of the work environment,
          Employees these days are not as motivated by simply a paycheck. If you
          want employees who are going to go to battle with and for you, they
          need to feel connected to a deeper purpose or mission.*

          > 

          > **Jasmin Terrany**, a psychotherapist and life coach who supports
          professionals.


          Creating a company mission also allows organizations to define what
          they stand for, which can lead to growth.


          To develop the right kind of mission, business owners need to be
          honest with themselves and look to tangible values beyond profit.
          These values, or view of the world, can attract the right kind of
          employees and provide an organization with a framework for success.


          > _The leader goes first. If you want a culture where people are
          honest and admit their failures, then you need to be the first one
          in._

          **Image:** One more step


          ### Part 1 - Define What You Do


          The first thing to do is to outline what your endeavor does. This may
          be goods you produce or services you provide to your customers. From a
          product perspective it may be the pain that is alleviated or the need
          that is satisfied.


          > It's important to not just state the obvious here and scratch the
          surface.

          > **What did I think here?**


          #### Workshop


          There is many ways of holding a workshop and further more elicitation
          and decision techniques that can be used to define what you do. The
          below procedure just represent one way of doing it. It should be seen
          as a inspiration or guide and tailored to suit you endeavors
          situation.


          ##### Step  1 - Silent Brainstorm

          The first step is to let each participant define what they think your
          endeavor do. The important thing here is to prevent co-operation and
          group thinking. Hence the participants should not be allowed to speak
          to each other or peek at each others sticky notes. A common way is to
          provide each participant with a block sticky-note, a pen and the
          instructions to write down as many of values they can think of within
          a given time, usually 2-4 minutes.


          ##### Step 2 - Open Review

          Once everybody is ready, it is now time for the open review. Each
          participant should in turn go up to the whiteboard and present their
          sticky-notes. The participant should present all their ideas, even if
          they have been mentioned by somebody else before. Once everybody has
          presented, the group should discuss the ideas presented. This is also
          a good time to group related ideas together.


          The group should in advance decide if they want everybody to present
          first and then comment, or if they want to comment as they go along.
          Different groups and cultures may have different preferences for such
          matters.


          Hearing other peoples suggestions, may trigger new ideas. It should be
          the facilitators responsibility to capture and presented them as well.


          ##### Step 3 - Dive Deeper

          The ideas may vary in the degree of specificity. This isn't in any way
          wrong, but often mean the underlay motivation doesn't come forth.


          The Five Why's is a good exercise to dig a little deeper and get more
          ideas.


          >**Five Whys Example - Robot Vacuum Cleaners**

          >* **What do we do?** Make Robot Vacuum Cleaners

          >    * **Why?** To help clean our customers houses

          >        * **Why?** To help our customers health though a clean living
          space.

          >    * **Why?** To automate household tasks

          >        * **Why?** To free up our customers time 

          >            * **Why?** To allow our customers to do the things they
          really enjoy

          >        * **Why?** To stop cohabitants fighting about household
          tasks.

          >            * **Why?** To let them have an enjoyable co-existence.

          >

          >Based on this, we could in addition to making robot vacuum cleaners
          say we are in the business of helping our customers live healthy and
          enjoyable lives.


          **_The Five Why's_** can be used in many forms to drill down to the
          deeper issue. Many people have preferences for how to use the
          technique, but there is no objective right or wrong way to do it. Find
          the method that works best for your group. In the above example we
          made a tree-structure and didn't ask why five times in any of the
          branches. That is fine, because we found a satisfactory root cause
          root early. 


          **Facilitator Note:** As we have not defined our customers yet, the
          notes with a specific customer type should be made generalized (i.e.
          call them the customer). The reason for this is to avoid unintentional
          constraints and influence on the participants thinking. If someone
          states who the customer is during this phase, it's important for the
          facilitator to emphasize that it is just one of the potential
          customers and such discussion should be taken in the next phase. Such
          a statement may influence the participants to try and identify other
          potential customer in their mind, hence mitigating the effects on the
          constraint. The facilitator should also note the customer type and
          acknowledge the contribution. 


          ##### Step 4 - Prioritization

          We have now collected ideas and dived deeper into some of those ideas.
          It is now time for the group to prioritize the ideas they find most
          important. We'll use the *dot voting technique* to accomplish this.
          Each participant will get an equal amount of small stickers where each
          represent one vote. The participants are free to spend their votes as
          they please. This includes not spending them, as well as using
          multiple votes for the same item. 


          It's important to note that this vote is not for elimination of ideas,
          but to give the group a shared picture of priorities. All the
          collected ideas should still be in play and the group should also
          welcome to add new ideas as they come.


          **Facilitator Notes:** It can be beneficial to be restrictive with the
          amount of stickers give to the participants. Not all the participants
          may want to use all their stickers. This may result in a skewness
          towards the ones is less reserved with their votes. If you see that
          the group wants more stickers, you can always give them more.
          Additional insight may also be gained by giving them a different color
          sticker for the second round.


          ##### Step 5 - Reflection

          Reflection comes in to forms: subconscious and conscious. Common for
          both of them, is that it requires some time. Dependent on the workshop
          plan, you may want to have a short break or a long break (i.e.
          multipart workshop).

          Cave](/assets/img/stock/luke-leung-14bvc2md9bk-unsplash.jpg

          **Image:** Reflections of Man in Cave


          ### Part 2 - Define Who You Do It For


          Next, describe the way in which your company does what it does. But
          instead of being technical — that's not the point here — think of what
          values go into the core of your business. Maybe you value quality or
          customer service, being sustainable, or you foster creativity and
          innovation in your business. These are key points to outline in your
          mission statement.


          #### Workshop


          The workshop for this phase is equal to the previous phase. If the
          participants is not familiar with the techniques and this way of
          working, expect significant improvements to this stage.  


          * Step 1 - Silent Brainstorm
              - We repeat the *Silent Brainstorm* from the previous phase with the new focus.
          * Step 2 - Open Review
              - We repeat the *Open Review* from the previous phase with the new focus.
          * Step 3 - Dive Deeper
              - We repeat the *Dive Deeper* from the previous phase with the new focus.
          * Step 4 - Prioritization
              - We repeat the *Prioritization* from the previous phase with the new focus.
          * Step 5 - Reflection
              - It's again time for a short reflection

          ### Part 3 -  Define Why You Do It


          This is the third time we repeat the workshop exercises.


          * Step 1 - Silent Brainstorm
              - We repeat the *Silent Brainstorm* from the previous phase with the new focus.
          * Step 2 - Open Review
              - We repeat the *Open Review* from the previous phase with the new focus.
          * Step 3 - Dive Deeper
              - We repeat the *Dive Deeper* from the previous phase with the new focus.
          * Step 4 - Prioritization
              - We repeat the *Prioritization* from the previous phase with the new focus.
          * Step 5 - Reflection
              - It's again time for a short reflection

          ### Part 4 - Put it together


          Finally, including why you do what you do in your mission statement is
          key. This helps you stand out as a business, highlighting what sets
          you apart from the others in your industry. Remember to keep the
          mission statement short and to the point.

          ### Part 5 - Review, Refine, Validate & Iterate


          After you've drafted it, remember to look it over, edit it, and have
          someone else give it the once over. After you've approved it, you'll
          need to find a way to incorporate it wherever you can including on
          your website or as part of your ad campaigns—anywhere that it's
          visible to your stakeholders.

          # Defining Your Vision


          [Source
          article](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/3882-vision-statement.html)



          Your vision is a statement of where you want to go and what you want
          to achieve. Its a image and representation that encompases your hopes
          and ambition. It should capure your core ideals and endure as a
          guiding star to where you want to go.  


          A vision statement is most commonly created for a
          company/organization, but is still valid for teams, products, services
          or other endevours. In this article we provide a step-by-step guide to
          writing your vision statement. Your vision will be strongly tied to
          your values. If you don't already have a clear picture of your values,
          it's recommended to first read [Defining your values]()


          ## Strategic Management Pyramid Series

          This is "Part 3" in a series of articles aimed to give a step-by-step
          guide to performing a Strategic Pyramid Analysis for your company,
          product or endevour.

          ## What is a vision statement?


          ## Who shall shapes your vision?




          ## Step 1 - Determining how the vision statement shall be used

          A vision statement should be concise, no longer than a sentence or
          two. You can create a longer version, but it should not be the one you
          broadcast to the world. Have a full-length version of your vision for
          the leadership's eyes only. Think of the long version as your
          reference guide to why you're in business in the first place."


          The vision can be smart and memorable, but this is for your team and
          culture, not for selling a specific product.


          ## Step 2 - Determining who will craft the statement

          The vision statement

          # Defining Your Strategic Objectives


          [Principles of Management - Strategic
          Objectives](https://opentextbc.ca/principlesofmanagementopenstax/chapter/strategic-objectives-and-levels-of-strategy/#:~:text=Strategic%20objectives%20are%20the%20big,share%20for%20the%20company's%20product.)


          Once a strategic analysis has been completed, the next step in the
          strategy process is to establish strategic objectives. At this point,
          is already established why the endevour exists and how it will try to
          fulfill its mission. Strategic analysis has provided information about
          customer preferences, competitors, and the endevours resources and
          capabilities. Now it is time to start planning for success.


          Strategic objectives are the big-picture goals for the endevour. They
          describe what the endevour will do to try to fulfill its mission.
          Strategic objectives are usually some sort of performance goal—for
          example, to launch a new product, increase profitability, or grow
          market share for the product.


          ## Procedure


          The three previous activities have been high level - as we move down
          the pyramid, the need for details get more important. This means
          having workshops where the participants only use what's in their heads
          wont suffice.
