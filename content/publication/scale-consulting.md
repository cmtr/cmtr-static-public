How do you scale a consulting business?

Here are some of the practices that have worked in my experience.

1. Hire rainmakers who can sell new work and bring in a team around them, great rainmakers create followership
2. Make sales a key focus, drive EBIT to 20% and gross margin to >50%
3. Migrate from a deals to an account mentality - have an account management model and hire people who can extend existing accounts - make that someones responsibility in each client team
4. Align incentives to work winning, work extending and delivery quality alongside practice, and IP development and people management
5. Have an antennae into the market around what clients are buying and what they really value - take every opportunity to ask for feedback and insight and use to adjust your propositions
6. Create IP from the methodologies you create - ideally a licence product you can spin out
7. Build a culture people love to work in - smaller consultancies wonâ€™t likely have the budget to compete on remuneration with larger firms
8. Be selective but have 1-2 partnerships where you mutually support on winning/delivering work
9. Work towards bigger deals as they generally cost the same to sell as smaller ones. Use smaller deals as door openers and learning opportunities
10. Ruthlessly manage cost discipline, hire a senior finance lead as soon as you can
11. Only take on risk reward deals on projects you have done numerous times and hence the predictability for success is high
12. Keep a lean support function, hire out of home market if skills can be more cheaply procured without compromising quality
13. Emphasise in all communications the impact you make - consultants love to talk about what they did but key is the impact made on clients' business
14. Keep fee rates under constant review, use pricing to your advantage
15. Become recognised experts - Do your consultants pass the 'googleability' test? - if you type their name into google do you find thought leadership, articles, presentations on what you want to be known for
16. Appoint someone to drive resourcing - this hire can save you on recruitment fees and drive consistent quality hires
17. Balance permanent employees and associates, use associates to manage peaks and troughs and incubate specialist skills
18. Proactively manage your bench, consultants love to be busy - first use for business development and second internal improvement projects
19. Use equity through shares and share options to motivate team members
20. Ensure in the first 10 seconds of someone visiting your website they know what you do
21. Get tough on client debts, chase them down and incentivise early payment
22. Define your niche specialism - specialists always win out
23. Undertake an ESG assessment early to find out areas to improve
24. Knit together regularly as a team to show an integrated approach to clients
25. Have fun along the way!
