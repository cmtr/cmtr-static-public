In today's digital age, data security has become an integral part of any enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM) system. As these systems hold a vast amount of sensitive business data, securing them against cyber attacks and data breaches is of utmost importance. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to secure your ERP/CRM system by implementing best practices and security measures to protect your organization's valuable data.

### Introduction
*IT Access and Security Governance* for an ERP IT System is established to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the system and to prevent unauthorized access, alteration or misuse of data. 

The following are key areas to consider for internal audit purposes:

1. **User Access Management:** The system should have a process in place to manage user access, which includes creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts. Access should be based on job responsibilities and need-to-know basis. Regular reviews of user access should be conducted to ensure that access rights are current and appropriate.
2. **Password Management:** Strong password policies should be implemented, including complexity requirements, regular password changes, and lockout after multiple failed login attempts. Users should be educated on the importance of strong passwords and password hygiene.
3. **Segregation of Duties:** Access controls should be implemented to separate duties between users to ensure that no one user has the ability to perform multiple critical functions. This helps to prevent fraud, errors, and misuse of data.
4. **Audit Trail:** The system should be configured to record all user activity, including system logs, audit trails, and event logs. This allows for the monitoring of access and activity, and can aid in the investigation of security incidents.
5. **Data Encryption:** Data should be encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access or theft, both in transit and at rest.
6. **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:** The system should have a disaster recovery plan in place to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster or system failure. This includes regular backups and testing of backups to ensure data is recoverable.
7. **Vendor Management:** For ERP/CRM systems hosted by a third-party vendor, the vendor's security policies and practices should be evaluated and monitored. This includes ensuring that the vendor has appropriate security controls in place, and that data is stored and transmitted securely.
8. **Training and Awareness:** Employees should be trained on the importance of IT security and best practices, including phishing prevention, secure password management, and how to report incidents.

Regular reviews and assessments of these controls should be conducted to ensure that the system remains secure and effective in mitigating risks. Internal audit should also review these controls periodically to ensure compliance with regulatory and internal policies.

### User Access Management

User Access Management is a critical aspect of IT access and security governance for an ERP/CRM IT system. In the context of two user groups, the company operating the system/platform and partners holding data in the system, there are different considerations and approaches to ensuring that access rights are managed appropriately to prevent conflicts of interest.

#### 1. Company Operating the System/Platform:
In the case of the company operating the system/platform, access rights should be based on the principle of least privilege, which means granting users only the access necessary to perform their job responsibilities. This is important to prevent conflict of interest as it limits the ability of employees to access or manipulate data for their own gain. Some key considerations for user access management for the company operating the system/platform are:

- **Role-based Access:** Access rights should be based on job responsibilities, with different levels of access assigned to different roles in the organization. This helps to ensure that users only have access to the data and functions necessary to perform their job responsibilities.
- **Segregation of Duties:** Access controls should be implemented to separate duties between users to ensure that no one user has the ability to perform multiple critical functions. This helps to prevent fraud, errors, and misuse of data.
- **User Access Reviews:** Regular reviews of user access should be conducted to ensure that access rights are current and appropriate. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to data and functions.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** To prevent unauthorized access, two-factor authentication (2FA) should be implemented, requiring users to provide two forms of authentication to access the system, such as a password and a code sent to a mobile device.

> ##### RBAC vs ABAC
>
> In Access Management, Role-based access control (RBAC) and Attribute-based access control (ABAC) are two widely used access control models.
>
> Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts access based on the role or job function of an authorized user within an organization. The access rights are associated with a particular role in the system, and users are granted access based on their role within the organization. This is typically the easiest and most straightforward approach to access control management.
>
> In contrast, Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an access control model that grants access based on a combination of attributes assigned to the user, the resource to be accessed, and the environment in which the access attempt is being made. This model provides a more granular approach to access control and allows access rights to be based on specific aspects of the user or the resource being accessed, rather than just the user's role. As a result, ABAC provides more fine-grained control over access to resources than RBAC.

#### 2. Partners Holding Data in the System:
In the case of partners holding data in the system, such as suppliers, customers, or other third-party entities, access rights should be managed separately from the company operating the system to prevent conflicts of interest. Some key considerations for user access management for partners holding data in the system are:

- **Partner Access Policies:** A partner access policy should be established to define the access rights granted to partners, based on their relationship with the company operating the system/platform. The access rights should be based on the principle of least privilege, and regular reviews should be conducted to ensure that access rights are current and appropriate.
- **Limited Access:** Partners should only be granted access to the data and functions necessary for their relationship with the company operating the system/platform. For example, a supplier may only need access to their order data, and should not be granted access to customer data.
- **Data Segregation:** Data should be segregated based on the partner's relationship with the company operating the system/platform. For example, supplier data should be segregated from customer data.
- **User Access Reviews:** Regular reviews of partner access should be conducted to ensure that access rights are current and appropriate, and to prevent unauthorized access to data and functions.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Two-factor authentication (2FA) should be implemented for partner access to prevent unauthorized access.


#### Conclusion
In summary, user access management is a critical aspect of IT access and security governance for an ERP IT system, and should be managed separately for the company operating the system/platform and partners holding data in the system. Access rights should be based on the principle of least privilege, with regular reviews conducted to ensure that access rights are current and appropriate. Segregation of duties and two-factor authentication should also be implemented to prevent conflicts of interest and unauthorized access.


### Password Management
Password management is an important aspect of IT access and security governance for any IT system, including an ERP IT system. Effective password management helps to ensure that users are using strong and unique passwords, and that those passwords are not easily guessable or accessible to unauthorized individuals. This is particularly important for an ERP IT system, which contains sensitive and confidential business data.

To effectively govern password management in an ERP IT system, the following best practices should be considered:

#### 1. Password Complexity and Strength Requirements:
To ensure that users are using strong and unique passwords, password complexity and strength requirements should be implemented. This includes requiring a minimum length, a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters, and preventing the use of easily guessable passwords such as "password" or "123456".

### 2, Password Expiration and Reset Policies:
To ensure that passwords are regularly changed and not reused, password expiration and reset policies should be implemented. This includes requiring users to change their passwords after a certain period of time, and preventing the reuse of old passwords.

#### 3. Two-Factor Authentication:
Two-factor authentication (2FA) should be implemented to provide an additional layer of security beyond just passwords. 2FA requires users to provide a second form of identification, such as a code sent to their mobile device, in addition to their password.

#### 4. Password Storage and Encryption:
Passwords should be stored and encrypted in a secure manner to prevent unauthorized access. This includes using strong encryption algorithms and secure storage mechanisms to protect passwords from being stolen or compromised.

#### 5. Password Sharing and Reuse Policies:
Policies should be implemented to prevent users from sharing passwords or reusing passwords across multiple systems. This helps to prevent the spread of password-related security incidents and ensures that each system has its own unique and secure password.

#### 6. Regular Password Audits:
Regular password audits should be conducted to ensure that users are adhering to password policies and best practices. This includes reviewing password complexity and expiration requirements, identifying weak passwords, and addressing any potential security risks related to password management.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, effective password management is an important aspect of IT access and security governance for an ERP IT system. To govern password management effectively, it is important to implement password complexity and strength requirements, password expiration and reset policies, two-factor authentication, secure password storage and encryption, password sharing and reuse policies, and regular password audits. These practices help to ensure that passwords are secure and not easily guessable or accessible to unauthorized individuals, helping to prevent security incidents and protect sensitive business data.

### Segregation of Duties (SoD)

Segregation of duties (SoD) is a critical aspect of IT access and security governance for an ERP IT system, particularly in the context of a B2B2X model where a company wholesales services to another company which sells these services to the end customer. The potential for conflict between the company operating the system and the partners holding data in the system is significant, making it even more important to ensure that SoD policies and procedures are in place.

SoD is the process of dividing key duties and responsibilities between different users to prevent any single user from having too much control over a particular process or function. In the context of a B2B2X model, SoD is particularly important for the wholesale prices and contracts, which are the primary risk and focus that needs securing.

To effectively govern SoD in this context, the following best practices should be considered:

#### 1. Identify Critical Processes and Functions:
The first step in effective SoD governance is to identify the critical processes and functions that need to be segregated. This includes all processes and functions related to wholesale pricing and contracts, as well as any other functions that are critical to the operation of the ERP IT system.

#### 2. Define Roles and Responsibilities:
Once the critical processes and functions have been identified, the next step is to define the roles and responsibilities of each user involved in those processes and functions. This should include a clear description of the tasks and activities that each user is responsible for, as well as any limitations on their access to data or systems.

#### 3. Implement Segregation of Duties Controls:
To prevent any single user from having too much control over a particular process or function, SoD controls should be implemented. This includes separating duties between different users to ensure that no one user has the ability to perform multiple critical functions. For example, the user responsible for entering wholesale pricing should not be the same user responsible for approving those prices.

#### 4. Regularly Review and Test SoD Controls:
SoD controls should be regularly reviewed and tested to ensure that they are working effectively. This includes regularly reviewing user access rights and testing controls to ensure that they are preventing conflicts of interest and other risks.

#### 5. Define SoD Policies and Procedures for Partners:
SoD policies and procedures should also be defined for partners holding data in the system. This includes defining the roles and responsibilities of partners, as well as implementing controls to ensure that partners only have access to the data and functions necessary for their relationship with the company operating the system/platform.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, SoD is a critical aspect of IT access and security governance for an ERP IT system, particularly in the context of a B2B2X model where a company wholesales services to another company which sells these services to the end customer. To effectively govern SoD in this context, it is important to identify critical processes and functions, define roles and responsibilities, implement SoD controls, regularly review and test those controls, and define SoD policies and procedures for partners. This helps to prevent conflicts of interest and other risks, and ensure the effective operation of the ERP IT system.

### Audit Trail
Audit trails are an essential component of IT access and security governance for any ERP IT system. An audit trail is a record of events that occur within the system, such as user actions, system changes, and third-party integrations. The purpose of an audit trail is to provide a traceable history of all activities within the system, which can be used to identify and investigate potential security incidents, compliance violations, or other issues.

To ensure that the audit trail is sufficient to satisfy good industry accounting practices for publicly traded companies, the following best practices should be considered:

#### 1. User Actions:
The audit trail should capture all user actions within the system, including logins, logouts, and any changes or updates made to data within the system. This includes tracking user activity such as creating, updating, or deleting records, as well as any reports that are run or exported from the system.

#### 2. Third-Party Integrations:
Any third-party integrations or APIs used by the ERP IT system should be monitored and audited to ensure that any actions triggered in those systems are captured in the audit trail. This includes tracking any data that is sent or received from external systems, as well as any changes or updates made to data within those systems.

#### 3. System Changes:
Any changes made to the ERP IT system or the infrastructure it operates on should be tracked and audited. This includes tracking changes to system configurations, updates or patches applied to the system, and any changes made to the underlying infrastructure such as servers, databases, or networking equipment.

#### 4. Price Management:
Price management is a critical aspect of ERP systems, particularly in the B2B2X business model. Any changes made to pricing within the system should be captured in the audit trail, including who made the changes, when they were made, and the reason for the change.

#### 5. Audibility and Traceability:
The audit trail should provide a sufficient level of audibility and traceability to satisfy good industry accounting practices for publicly traded companies. This includes ensuring that the audit trail is secure and tamper-proof, and that it is retained for a sufficient period of time to allow for proper investigation and analysis.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, audit trails are an essential component of IT access and security governance for any ERP IT system. To ensure that the audit trail is sufficient to satisfy good industry accounting practices for publicly traded companies, it is important to capture all user actions, track third-party integrations, monitor system changes, track price management, and provide a sufficient level of audibility and traceability. By implementing these best practices, organizations can ensure that their ERP IT system is secure, compliant, and effectively managed.

Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure, unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information. In the context of GDPR compliance and the use of an American Cloud Provider within European borders, there are several key considerations to take into account.

#### 1. GDPR Compliance:
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation that applies to all companies that process the personal data of EU citizens, regardless of where the company is located. The GDPR mandates that companies take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data they process, including the use of encryption.

To ensure GDPR compliance, it is important to ensure that all personal data processed by the ERP IT system is encrypted both at rest and in transit. This includes ensuring that all databases, file systems, and backups are encrypted, as well as ensuring that any data transmitted over the internet is encrypted using secure protocols such as SSL/TLS.

#### 2. American Cloud Provider within European borders:
The GDPR also places restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, including to American cloud providers. While it is possible to use American cloud providers within European borders, it is important to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the personal data being processed.

One way to ensure compliance is to use encryption to protect the personal data being processed. This includes encrypting data both at rest and in transit, as well as ensuring that any encryption keys are securely managed and stored.

Another important consideration is to ensure that the American cloud provider is GDPR-compliant and has appropriate data protection measures in place. This includes ensuring that the provider has appropriate data protection policies and procedures, as well as providing adequate assurances that they will comply with GDPR requirements.

#### Conclusion
In summary, data encryption is an important aspect of IT access and security governance for any ERP IT system. To ensure GDPR compliance and the use of an American cloud provider within European borders, it is important to encrypt all personal data both at rest and in transit, ensure appropriate key management, and ensure that the cloud provider is GDPR-compliant and has appropriate data protection measures in place. By taking these steps, organizations can ensure that their ERP IT system is secure, compliant, and effectively managed.

### Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
Disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity (BC) are critical components of IT access and security governance for any ERP IT system. These processes ensure that an organization can continue to operate in the event of a disaster or other disruptive event, such as a power outage, natural disaster, or cyberattack.

#### Disaster Recovery:

Disaster recovery is the process of restoring IT infrastructure, applications, and data after a disaster or disruptive event. This includes restoring data backups, repairing or replacing hardware, and ensuring that all systems are operational and accessible.

To ensure effective disaster recovery, organizations should have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in place that outlines procedures for restoring critical systems and data. The plan should also include a backup strategy that specifies how data will be backed up, where backups will be stored, and how backups will be restored in the event of a disaster.
