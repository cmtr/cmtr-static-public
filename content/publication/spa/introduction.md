### Introduction

The *Strategic Pyramid* or *Strategic Management Pyramid* comes in many forms and is common occurance in *Product Management, Brand Development, Business Strategy, Change Management* and more. Common to all of them is strategy at the top of the pyramid, supported by tactics in the middle, and actions at the base. **Ideas a cheap, execution is everything.** A strategy is nothing without tactics and action to make it realize them.

In this first article in the series, we will discuss the value of analysis and discuss what you should consider before starting a analysis. In the next article we will provide an introduction to the Strategic Pyramid model. Then break down each stage, before conluding.

### The Value of Analysis
Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel, states in his book [*High Output Management*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324750.High_Output_Management) that the value of a report is not created in it's consumption, but rather it's creation. When writing a report, or performing a analysis, the details are checked and any logical inconsistencies uncovered are addressed. So the simple answer to why it is important is: **validation**. *External* validation of you, your company to existing and potential customers, and more importantly *internal* validation to youself and endevours members.

In short
* it can save you and your team time by catching problems while they are small.
* it can unlock new insight, that either increases the value of the endevour or kills it before resources is wasted persueing it.
* it can save team frustration and improve performance, by having a clear end goal of what is to be accomplished. 
* it can save cost by reducing rework.

### Consideration for Weather Analysis is for You
Is it always good to perform a deep and through analysis? The short answer for this question is NO. While doing a deep and through analysis can give you a clear direction, it  

There is many factors that comes into play:
* What is your teams maturity? 
* What is the caracteristics of your endevour?
* Who is the endevours benefactors?
* What is the endevours scope?
* What is the competitive state?


##### Team Maturity
A thorough analysis requires disciplined and structured approach. This may require that established truths and cultural norms established in the team are challanged. Your teams maturity working in this manner and acceptance of encroachment of what's holy to them is imperative for accomplishing the desired outcome. It is also important that once the result of a analysis is completed that the team accepts lives by the accompanying action plan (even though they still may not agree).

If there is strong doubt about the teams ability to do this, then outside help may maybe considered or a more agile and iterative approach may be applicable.

##### The Characteristics of What You Offer
Is your endevour specialized or generalized? Specialized products, services and companies have a very clear purpose: *"To make money doing the thing only they know."* I.e. for those who need their products or services, it's not difficult to understand how they compare to others.

Generic products, like bottled water or vodka, have by defintion essitional the same physical properties. The only differentiating factor for such products is the products perception in the customers mind. In the first case, a thourgh analysis won't make much difference, but for the other it's essential.

How about services? Where does freelancers and consultants fall into this landscape? People are different, but jobs often the same. If you are a developer specialized in a given ERP solution, your knowledge and skillset is highly specialized. If you are primarilly working with people, such as in Project/Product Management, Business Analysis, or UX design, then your knowledge and skillset is usally generalized.

##### The Endevours Benefactors
If your buyers are large industrial companies with institusionalized purchasing departments, there is mainly one questions they needed to know the answer to: *"Does your products and services save us money or help us make more?"* They may communicate they want to build or maintain long term relatiionships, but this isn't always communicated to the pruchasing department nor in line with their success criteria. In that case, building a good narrative may have limited value. 

If your buyers are private consumers or individual decision makers, they can be significantly more influenced by a brand image, good story, and presentation. The *"Why"* of what you offer then be the

> We differentiate here between *the buyers* - the people with authority to sign the contract - and *the users* or *the client* - the people who use the proudcts or services. Their preferences may not be the same.


### Consideration Before Starting a Analysis

There is many considerations you should take before starting. We'll go through a few of these here.

##### Analysis Participants

When starting a strategic pyramid analysis it's important to remember that it's a team effort. People have different values and perspectives. Choosing the right people - either as participants or as information sources - is important to ensure that the result of the analysis truely reflects the wider team.

If you are a solo freelancer without a team, use the people close to you (and they'll be glad to help).

##### Descision Making
The processes and techniques described in this series promoto the use of consensus as a descision making technique. Where not possible, people in western countries will tend default for a more democratic technique such as majority rule. Most businesses are neither democratic nor consensus based, they are totalitarian with one person being the final decision maker. Experience tells us that if the team comes to a conclusion that the descision maker does not fully support, then the work will shift to his original idea after some time. It's better to give *The Decider* the veto power from the start.

> If *The Decider* is given veto power and final say, it's very important that all participants give their opinions, input and votes before *The Decider* shows their cards. The workshop's foucs is then to broaden and influence *The Decider* perspective and opinion.

##### External Help
It can be tempting to use external help to perform such a analysis. Particularly when the team is not familiar with the such analysis work. It does however depend on the short versus long term objective. 

In the long run your team will be stronger by having the competence and capability itself. It will give your analyst *skin in the game* - and the associated scars - by having to live with outcome of both the analysis and the endevour. Aquiring this competence will take time and effort, but it will payout in the long run. 

Endevours often have short term constraints that limits the teams ability to aquire the competence themselves. In such situations, you should first check if an external facilitator is acceptable. This puts the responsibility of the analysis on the team, but outsiders help with setting the framework. 

If a facilitator is used, then it is especially important that they are exactly that, a facilitator (and a coach). If they also perform the analysis you will lose ownership to the process in the long run.

When time is really pressing, it may be beneficial to have a external analyst perform the analysis. Situations do accure when this is the best option, but one should be very carefull. 


There is also other situations where using external help for the analysis is beneficial? Sometimes you actually want a fancy, flashy and shallow analysis which you have no intention on following up on. E.g. When you have a product that is highly specialized and sell on merit and value alone, but it's a pre-requesite for complaiance, marketing or to be taken serious by certain stakeholders (such as investors, customers, employees, competitors, the public, etc.) a shallow analysis may be just what you need. In such cases using a external analyst may be just what the doctor ordered.

There is also the situation where you want to train a internal resourse to do the role, but want a experienced resource to bring them quickly up to speed.

> The _Strategic Pyramid_ is a favourite amoung *Management Consultants*, and as with much of their work, it's often something that is percieved as fancy, flashy and shallow rather than something that is actually usefull or lived by. Even though it has a bad reputation - most often due to lack of ownership in the recieving organization - but done right it can act as a strong power amplifier.

> *Mangement Consultants* and *Professional* that specialize in these types of analysis is in fact very experienced and knowledgeable. So, why shouldn't you use external help? It's all about having "*skin in the game*". Firstly, while they are experienced at the analysis, but they are rarely experienced at the execution in the context of your endevour. Secondly, their incentives does not always align with the company's objectives.

> A internal resource that owns the process and analysis will have to live with the consequences throughout it's execution and life span. He will - over time - have the knowledged about the unique minute details about the companys culture and ways of working that can makes the difference between success and failure.
