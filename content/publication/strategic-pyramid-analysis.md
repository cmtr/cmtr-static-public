Business strategy is a critical component of any organization's success. To effectively execute a strategy, it's essential to have a clear understanding of your company's mission, vision, goals, and objectives. The Strategic Pyramid is a framework that helps businesses structure their strategy and ensures that all efforts are aligned with their overarching purpose. In this article, we'll dive into the Strategic Pyramid concept and provide step-by-step instructions for how to perform it. We'll explore each level of the pyramid and explain how it fits into the larger strategy. By the end of this article, you'll have a better understanding of how to develop a comprehensive and cohesive strategy for your business using the Strategic Pyramid. Whether you're a small startup or a large corporation, this framework can help you achieve your goals and fulfill your mission.

### Strategic Pyramid

The Strategic Pyramid is a framework used in business strategy that represents the hierarchy of strategic objectives from the highest level down to the most specific actions required to achieve those objectives. It consists of four levels:

1. **Mission:** At the top of the pyramid is the organization's mission statement, which defines the company's overall purpose, values, and long-term goals.

2. **Vision:** The second level of the pyramid is the vision statement, which describes the future state the company aspires to achieve. The vision statement is often more specific than the mission statement, providing a clear picture of what the company wants to become.

3. **Goals and objectives:** The third level of the pyramid includes the specific goals and objectives that the company needs to achieve to reach its vision. These objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

4. **Strategies and tactics:** The final level of the pyramid is where the specific strategies and tactics are developed to achieve the objectives. These are the action plans that the company will use to reach its goals, and they should be aligned with the organization's mission and vision.

The Strategic Pyramid provides a clear structure for companies to set their objectives and develop strategies to achieve them. By starting with the mission and vision, companies can ensure that all strategies and tactics are aligned with the overall purpose of the organization, and that they are working towards a shared future state.

#### Mission vs Vision
A mission statement and a vision statement are two important components of an organization's overall strategy, but they serve different purposes.

A mission statement outlines the organization's purpose, goals, and overall approach to achieving its objectives. It defines the organization's reason for being and what it does to provide value to its stakeholders, such as customers, employees, and shareholders. A mission statement is typically short and concise, focusing on the present and immediate future, and it often includes specific actions or activities that the organization will undertake to achieve its objectives.

On the other hand, a vision statement describes the organization's aspirations for the future. It provides a clear and inspiring picture of what the organization hopes to achieve over the long term, often describing a future state or goal that is challenging but attainable. A vision statement is typically broader and more abstract than a mission statement, focusing on the big picture and the organization's desired impact on the world.

In short, a mission statement is about what the organization does, while a vision statement is about where it is going. Both statements are critical for developing a comprehensive strategy that aligns with the organization's purpose, values, and long-term goals.

### Mission
Defining your company's mission is an essential step in creating a clear direction and focus for your business. Your mission statement communicates your company's purpose, values, and long-term goals to your stakeholders, including employees, customers, investors, and the broader community. However, many businesses struggle with defining their mission and articulating it in a clear and concise way. In this chapter, we'll provide step-by-step procedures for defining your company's purpose, values, and long-term goals using design thinking, with the specific intent of using these elements to create a compelling and effective mission statement. We'll explore each element in detail and provide practical tools and techniques to help you clarify and communicate your organization's mission and vision. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a better understanding of how to create a strong foundation for your business and craft a mission statement that resonates with your stakeholders and reflects your company's values and aspirations. Whether you're a small startup or a large corporation, these procedures can help you create a more meaningful and impactful organization.

> **Design Thinking** is a _human-centered problem-solving methodology_ used to solve complex problems by empathizing with the end-users, defining the problem, ideating solutions, prototyping and testing them iteratively. It involves a collaborative and iterative process of understanding user needs, brainstorming creative solutions, prototyping and testing those solutions, and refining them until they meet the user's needs. The Design Thinking method puts a strong emphasis on empathy and user-centered design, encouraging designers to put themselves in the shoes of the user and understand their needs and pain points. It is widely used in various industries, including product design, business strategy, and innovation, to develop innovative solutions that meet the needs of customers and end-users. The key benefit of the Design Thinking method is its ability to encourage creativity and collaboration, leading to the development of innovative solutions that can have a meaningful impact on people's lives.

#### Defining Your Purpose
Here is a step-by-step procedure for defining your company's overall purpose using design thinking:

1. **Empathize:** The first step is to empathize with your customers and stakeholders. Gain a deeper understanding of their needs, desires, and pain points. Conduct research, surveys, and interviews to gather insights into their perspectives.

2. **Define:** Based on your research, define the problem or opportunity that your company is uniquely positioned to solve. Clearly articulate the problem and how it aligns with your company's mission and values.

3. **Ideate:** Brainstorm potential solutions to the problem or opportunity. Encourage your team to think creatively and consider a variety of options. Use tools like mind mapping and brainstorming to generate ideas.

4. **Prototype:** Develop prototypes of your potential solutions. This could involve creating a product, service, or marketing campaign that aligns with your company's purpose. Test these prototypes with your customers and stakeholders to gather feedback and refine your approach.

5. **Test:** Finally, test your solution by putting it into action. Measure its impact and gather feedback from your customers and stakeholders. Use this feedback to refine your solution and continue iterating until you find the optimal approach.

By using design thinking to define your company's overall purpose, you can ensure that your business is focused on solving real problems and creating value for your customers and stakeholders.

2. **Define:** Once you've gained a better understanding of yourself, it's time to define your values. Write down the words and phrases that come to mind when you think about what's important to you. Don't worry about editing or prioritizing at this stage, just brainstorm as many ideas as possible.

3. **Ideate:** With your list of values in hand, start to ideate on how you can prioritize them. Consider the relationships between the values, and which ones are most critical to your happiness and success. Try to narrow your list down to no more than 10 values.

4. **Prototype:** Once you have your list of prioritized values, it's time to prototype them. Write each value on a separate index card, and create a mind map that connects them together. Play around with the arrangement of the cards until you find a configuration that makes sense to you.

5. **Test:** The final step is to test your values. Put them into action by making decisions based on your new priorities. Pay attention to how you feel when you act in accordance with your values. If something doesn't feel right, go back and refine your list.

By using design thinking to define your values, you can gain a deeper understanding of what matters most to you. This process can help you make better decisions, set more meaningful goals, and live a more authentic life.

#### Defining Your Long Term Goals

### Goals & Objectives

In the third level of the strategic pyramid we are defining your company's goals and objectives. In the previous levels, we discussed how to define your company's purpose, values, and long-term goals using design thinking, and how to create a mission statement and vision based on these elements.

Now that you have a clear understanding of your company's overall direction and values, it's time to translate them into specific, measurable, and achievable goals and objectives. This chapter will guide you through a step-by-step procedure to define your goals and objectives using the SMART framework, taking into consideration your company's mission statement and vision.

By following this process, you will be able to align your company's goals with its overall purpose, values, mission, and vision, create a clear path to success, and measure progress towards achieving your desired outcomes. In this chapter, we will cover the key steps involved in defining your goals and objectives, including how to set specific and measurable goals, determine realistic timelines, and establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear understanding of how to set and achieve your company's goals, and be well on your way to realizing your mission and vision. This process will help you to focus your efforts, prioritize your resources, and make informed decisions that lead to long-term success for your company.

> **SMART** is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. SMART goals are a framework used for setting and achieving goals that are clear, measurable, and realistic. Specific means the goal should be clear and well-defined. Measurable means that there should be a way to track progress towards achieving the goal. Achievable means that the goal should be realistic and attainable. Relevant means that the goal should be aligned with the overall business strategy and mission. Time-bound means that the goal should have a specific deadline or timeline for completion. The SMART framework is a widely used approach in personal and professional settings, as it provides a clear structure for setting goals that are achievable and have a clear path to success. By setting SMART goals, individuals and organizations can increase their chances of success and achieve their desired outcomes.

#### Goals vs. Objectives
Goals and objectives are both important components of a strategic plan, but there are some key differences between the two.

A goal is a broad statement of what you want to achieve, often expressed in qualitative terms. It describes a desired outcome, but does not provide specific details on how that outcome will be achieved or how progress towards the goal will be measured. Goals are typically focused on the long-term, and may take several years to achieve.

In contrast, objectives are specific, measurable, and time-bound statements of what you need to do to achieve your goals. They provide a clear roadmap for achieving the desired outcome, and are often expressed in quantitative terms. Objectives are usually shorter-term and can be achieved within a few months to a year.

In other words, goals are the big-picture, long-term outcomes that you want to achieve, while objectives are the specific actions you need to take to get there. Goals are often more general and aspirational, while objectives are more detailed and specific.

For example, a goal might be to become a leader in your industry, while an objective could be to increase your market share by 10% within the next year. The goal describes the desired outcome, while the objective provides a specific target and timeframe for achieving that outcome.

Overall, both goals and objectives are important for guiding your organization's strategic planning and ensuring that everyone is working towards a common vision. By setting clear goals and defining specific objectives, you can create a roadmap for success and track your progress towards achieving your long-term vision.
