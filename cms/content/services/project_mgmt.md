In today’s competitive business world, you need steady and experienced management to guide your strategies. *Product Management* and *Project, Program & Portfolio Management* are very important and complimantary domains that - yet distinct - are often interchangeably confused by all levels of business executives.

We provide advisory services to help you tailor your *Governance* for *Product, Project, Program or Portfolio* to meet requirements for your organization. Our advisors will join and help you to tailor, implement and socialize the methodologies - from predictive to agile - that best suits your company, product, culture, team and risk.

### Predictive vs. Agile
Agile and waterfall are two distinctive methodologies of processes to complete projects or work items. Agile is an iterative methodology that incorporates a cyclic and collaborative process. Waterfall is a sequential methodology that can also be collaborative, but tasks are generally handled in a more linear process.

Following the agile methodology, your project will move through a series of cycles throughout the lifetime of the project. The development phase, review, feedback, and then approval of the work item – either yes or no. If yes, implement and complete the task. If no, record and make any necessary changes, track and adjust the backlog or prioritization to reflect the newly acquired knowledge, and then move onto the next task or sprint.

Following the waterfall methodology is a simpler process of moving tasks through the phases of defining requirements, designing the implementation, implementing the work item, verification of implementation and quality assurance, and then maintenance of the feature in the end.

Selecting the right methodology for your projects will depend on preference and the nature of each project. The answer is rarely either pure Waterfall or pure Agile. Some projects require a more iterative process and others require a more sequential approach. 


### Standards from the Project Management Institute

Our advisors are knowledgeable and certified by [Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) in their domain. The company has by policy decided to rely primarilly on the *PMI Standards for Project, Program and Portfolio Management* as they fit the companys profile of being tailorable (to the individual ned), broad (generalized to meet most needs) and guidelines (advisory) based. This does however not mean that we limit our selves to them and ignore the lessons from competing standars and frameworks.
