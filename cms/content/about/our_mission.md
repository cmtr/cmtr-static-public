# Our Mission

Our mission is _**Helping business do the unfamiliar**_. 


### Why are we helping
We love to learn and use our cognitive abilities in order to meet our needs to grow as people. One could say that our our motivation sits right at the top of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). We find that one of the best ways to achieve this, is by helping others turn the different and strange into the normal and ordinary. 

When we say that we _**"help business do the unfamiliar"**_. We mean we want to enable our clients to do the job. That we assit in analysis of the situation, identification of the problem and implementation of the solution, but we're not the ones that continuouly performing job after that. This is why we say we help our clients by joining and guiding them through their journey of turning their challanges into their new business as usual.

### Who are we helping
Our target clients is business and organizations that are highly specialized, facing unfamiliar situations, or just need a outsider perspective.  

We think that most business are rigged to their own normalcy. They have over time specialized their organization, people, processes and culture to create a normalzy that is optimized and incrementally enhanced for generating value for their customers within their niche. I.e. their strenght lay in being rigged to do the same thing in a consisten and continiual manner. 

Such organizations often attracts people that like the opportunities of specialization or predictability they can offer. The trade-off such organization often accept is that they become less flexible, adaptable and agile. This due to the inertia created by their mindsets, ways of working and earlier commitments and capital investments.

### How are we helping
We love new challanges and we know how to face the unknown, unfamiliar and stange. 

We know that just because something is new to you, doesn't mean it new to everyone. We help our clients by assiting them in the search for what their problem truely is, finding who has solve the problem in the past and how they did it, and in the end helping them address it in their organization themselves. 

We stive to make our clients independent of us. _Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime._ If we done the job right, they will come back to us when the environment necessitates that fishing must be supplimented by hunting.

> *“Favoring specialization over intelligence is exactly wrong, especially in high tech. The world is changing so fast across every industry and endeavor that it's a given the role for which you're hiring is going to change. Yesterday's widget will be obsolete tomorrow, and hiring a specialist in such a dynamic environment can backfire. A specialist brings an inherent bias to solving problems that spawns from the very expertise that is his putative advantage, and may be threatened by a new type of solution that requires new expertise. A smart generalist doesn't have bias, so is free to survey the wide range of solutions and gravitate to the best one.”*
