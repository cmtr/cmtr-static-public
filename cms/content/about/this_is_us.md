# This Is Us

Most business are rigged to do their own normalcy. They have over time specialized their organization, people, processes and culture to create a normalcy that is optimized and incrementally enhanced for generating value for their customers within their niche. Their core strength lay in being rigged to do the same thing in a consistent and continual manner. Such organizations further tend to attract people that like the opportunities of specialization or predictability they can offer. A common trade-off such organization accept is that they become less flexible, adaptable and agile. This due to the inertia of their mindsets, ways of working, earlier commitments and existing capital investments. 

CMTr was started to meet the challenges faced by such organizations. As outsiders trying to understand their way of operating, we are not constrained by their normalcy. What is natural to them is new to us. This gives us the opportunity to challenge the *established truths*, question the  *status quo* and provide new perspectives or insights.

Our mission is *Helping business do the unfamiliar* because we enjoy stepping into the unfamiliar. More importantly enjoy the journey of turning it into the familiar. We help our clients by joining and guiding them through their journey of turning the unfamiliar to their new normal. 

We are avid generalist with a broad set knowledge of technology, psychology, organization, management & leadership, language & culture, and more. We thrive too learn, to be challenged, to have our convictions challenged, to feed our curiosity and to meet our potential.
