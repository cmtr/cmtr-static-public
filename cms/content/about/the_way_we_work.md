We define our selves as a **_Your Independent Generalist Advisory Service_** which is closely tied to our values as followes: 

* The _independence_ is reflected in our company valeus as *Take **Ownership** and Always act with **Integrity***. This is how we act. 
* The _generalist_ approach is reflected in our company's values as *Be **Curious** to all things and **Dive Deep** in to the matter*. This how we learn and improve.
* The _advisory_ perspective is reflected in our company's values as *Be nice to **People** and **Inspire** greatness in others*. This is how we work together.

To implement this in the day to day way we work, we use _Our Guiding Model that Drives All Our Efforts_. The model guides us in the areas of which we work - the instersection between *business, technology, organization* and *people* - and guides us by allways considering all things from the following it's four perspectives.

### The Types of Endevours, Problems & Challanges

The military defines treaths by looking at them from two perspectives: 1) the knowledgeability about the treath, and 2) the knowledge of the treath caracteristics. A _known-known_ treath is one where they have knowledge about both the existence and characteristics of. A _unknown-known_ treath is one where they donot have knowledge of, but the characteristics is generally known. A _know-unknown_ is risk they knowledge of, but not the exact characteristics of (e.g. a "Lone Wolf"). Lastly, a _unknown-unknown_ is one which there is no knowledge about both of its existence and characteristics (e.g. a "Black Swan").

For both the military and business, the _unknown-unknown_ represents the biggest challange. In business, this is problem or opportunity that Peter Thiel would categorize as going from *[Zero to One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One)*. However, in business it is not the most frequent endevour, challange or problem faced. Most businesses models are of the type *One to Many* or *Many to Many*. Further more, most challenges and problems with organizing a business is also common amoung all businesses. They are accordingly faced with problems and challanges in the categories of _known-knowns_, _unknown-knowns_, and _known-unkowns_. Thus, the problems they face is not one of insufficent information, but rather one of correct utilization of the available information.

This assumption that most endevours, challanges and problems faced with businesses today on one of correct utilization of information, we have established _our guiding model_ for how to approach and evaluate them. 

### Our Guiding Model
The basis for _our guiding model_ is to allways evaluate the endevour, challange or problem from the following perspectives:
* **Business** - Why
* **Organization** - How
* **Technology** - What
* **People** - Who

### The Business Perspective
The business perspective represents the why of the endevour, challange or problem. E.g. why a product is being created, why a project is being performed, or why is it it a problem. For us this encompases the need, reason for effort and desired value to be obtained.

> - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things

### The Organization Perspective
The organizational perspective represents the how of the endovour, challange or problem. How are the resources, both people, capital and technology, organized to address to problem to day? How can they be organized to achieve the desired outcome? 

> _“Norman’s Law: The day the product team is announced, it is behind schedule and over its budget.”_
> - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things

### The Technology Perspective
The technology perspective representents the what - or the outcome - of the endevour, challange or problem. The definition of technology is _the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes"_. In our view, technology limited to machinery, equipment and code, but also includes the governenace, processes, standardization, best practice, etc. that achieves the practical purpose.

> _“It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.”__
> - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things

### The People Perspective
The people perspective represent the whom of the endevour, challange or problem. It is the people it's created by; it is the people it's created for; and it is directly related to all the three other categories. We have placed it in the center of our model because it should always be considered. A process that goes against human nature is doomed to fail, a software that causes alot of cognitive strain will not be used, organization around a single person is susptible for collapse and a business need that does address a persons need will have no champion. 

> _“The vicious cycle starts: if you fail at something, you think it is your fault. Therefore you think you can’t do that task. As a result, next time you have to do the task, you believe you can’t, so you don’t even try. The result is that you can’t, just as you thought.”__
> - **Donald A. Norman**, The Design of Everyday Things

### The Intersection
The intersection perspective is the synthezis of the business, organization, technology and people perspective. With a good understanding of the endevour, challange or problem from each of these perspectives, the solution usually become obvious. It is also when all these perspectives is understood that a solutions, which may be minor in scope, can result in efficiencies measured in the orders of magnitude.

### Credits
We do not take credit for this model.It's a generic model that exists in many forms and variations. One example is the [PMI Talent Triangle](https://www.pmi.org/learning/training-development/talent-triangle) where the application is the human capital and talent management. We also want to give credits to Donald A. Norman for the influence his work has guided the work way we work and would encourge all our clients to read his book [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things).
